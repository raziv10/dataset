The wisecracks, zingers and put downs pile up like freshly raked leaves. And GRUMPY OLD MEN become grumpier in the sequel that's ""pure delight, a wonderfully warmhearted comedy"" (David Sheehan, CBS-TV). Grabbing fishing rods and picking up where they left off, JACK LEMMON and WALTER MATTHAU reel in another comedy winner as GRUMPIER OLD MEN. ANN-MARGRET, DARYL HANNAH, KEVIN POLLACK and BURGESS MEREDITH also return to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to reprise their roles. And SOPHIA LOREN is the newcomer whose plan to turn the town's beloved bait shop into a ristorante sends the old boys into a tizzy. Be advised: a tizzy is very contagious. Get ready to laugh.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) fights his old friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) and his wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) for control of his Las Vegas empire.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The inner-workings of a corrupt Las Vegas casino are exposed in Martin Scorsese's story of crime and punishment. The film chronicles the lives and times of three characters: ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a bookmaking wizard; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime best friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in a role she was born to play), a leggy ex-prostitute with a fondness for jewelry and a penchant for playing the field. Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voiceover, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film's first hour and a half details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick apart their Camelot piece by piece.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a futuristic world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
An intense film about time travel, this sci-fi entry was directed by Terry Gilliam, a member of the comedy troupe Monty Python. The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle.

When he found the power to express what was in his heart, he found the love of a lifetime.

Mario (Oscar® nominee Massimo Troisi in his final screen performance) is a newly appointed mailman who is madly in love with the most beautiful woman in town, Beatrice Russo (Maria Grazia Cucinotta). Bumbling, interminably shy and far too nervous to tell her how he feels, Mario becomes inspired when a world-famous Chilean poet visits the small island community. Pablo Neruda (Award winning actor Philippe Noiret, Cinema Paradiso) is a revelation to the otherwise introverted and soft spoken Mario and with his expert help Mario not only finds the right words to woo Beatrice but has a fighting chance to win her over.",50063,134,6,PT1M54S,0

But like many of us, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) never could have predicted the course his own life would take, when he reluctantly accepts a job as a teacher. 

A musician and composer consumed with a love for music, Holland's true goal is to write one memorable piece of music to leave his mark on the world. But instead, he finds his calling in the most unlikely place, sharing his love of music with his students--to let it fill their lives, the way it fills his. His students respond to his contagious passion, and as the years unfold, Holland finds himself on an unplanned path. 

Redefining success and his own dreams, Holland realizes that his legacy will be greater than he ever dreamed. And with the help of his students and his family, Glenn Holland learns that though our lives don't always turn out the way we plan them, life is what happens when you embrace the unexpected.

Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) Official Trailer #1

""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking your Juice in the Hood"" is a parody of a lot of black U.S. movies, for instance ""Boyz n the Hood"", ""South Central"", ""Menace II Society"", ""Higher Learning"" and ""Juice"". We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. Crazy stuff happens. For example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.

Blue in the Face (1995) Official Trailer 1 - Harvey Keitel Movie

Wayne Wang's follow-up movie to Smoke presents a series of improvisational situations strung together to form a pastiche of Brooklyn's diverse ethnicity, offbeat humor, and essential humanity. Many of the same characters inhabiting Auggie Wren's Brooklyn Cigar Store in Smoke return here to expound on their philosophy of smoking, relationships, baseball, New York, and Belgian Waffles. Most of all, this is a movie about living life, off-the-cuff.

Faced with sagging approval ratings and disgruntled arms manufacturers, the U.S. President (Alda) decides to cook up a new Cold War with Canada! And after a flood ofmedia propaganda, Americans waste no time in ""patriotically"" burning their ice skates and swearing off maple syrup.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Taplow (Ben Silverstone) attempts to ask a favor of Mr. Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney), a spiteful headmaster on the verge of retirement.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Forty-three years after the first screen treatment of Terence Rattigan's play about a teacher facing the end of his career, Albert Finney takes on the role of Mr. Crocker-Harris, the Latin teacher forced into early retirement by a heart condition. After teaching in a public school for twenty years, Crocker-Harris is being put out to pasture in a less stressful job teaching English to foreigners. Meanwhile, his home life is also falling apart: his wife (Greta Scacchi) is having an affair with the American chemistry teacher (Matthew Modine), who nevertheless admires Crocker-Harris for his dignity and decency. Through it all, Crocker-Harris hides his pain behind his stiff British reserve.

"" Time never dies. The circle is never round. ""

The first film made in the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, Milcho Manchevski's Before the Rain crosscuts the stories of an orthodox Christian monk (Grégoire Colin), a British photo agent (Katrin Cartlidge), and a native Macedonian war photographer (Rade Šerbedžija) to paint a portrait of simmering ethnic and religious hatred about to reach its boiling point. Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema's most powerful laments on the futility of war.

The movie won more than 30 awards including Golden Lion in Venice and earned an Oscar nomination!

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A day in the lives of two convenience clerks as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
When Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is reluctantly put in charge of the Quick Stop market on his day off, he tries, though half-heartedly, to perform his minimum-wage duties as efficiently as possible. This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service. Much of the film consists of Randall and Dante's criticism of their customers, their lives, and the world in general. Clerks, filmed in black-and-white on a budget of only $27,000, began the career of writer director Kevin Smith, who would go on to make Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Hit men, gangsters and robbers converge in Quentin Tarantino's violent tale of revenge. Stars John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.

Inspired by the paranoid visions of John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds, the desert noir of Detour and the black and white widescreen beauty of Hiroshi Teshigahara’s The Face of Another and Woman of the Dunes, Suture is one of great feature debuts – by writer-directors David Siegel and Scott McGehee – and a truly unique piece of cinema.

The wealthy and self-assured Vincent (Michael Harris) meets his blue collar half-brother Clay (Dennis Haysbert) at their father’s funeral and is struck by their similarity. He decides to murder Clay and take his identity, only Clay survives the assassination attempt with no memory and is mistaken for Vincent. The fact that Harris is white and Haysbert is black only complicates a film that probes into the nature of identity.

After viewing an early rough cut, Steven Soderbergh came on board as executive producer and enthusiastic patron. Suture went on to become a hit on the festival circuit, including Sundance where it deservedly won the award for Best Cinematography.

FILM SYNOPSIS
A spellbinding account of the career of the most renowned woman director, best known as Hitler's moviemaker and recently hailed by The New York Times as ""one of the greatest woman filmmakers ever."" In this remarkable documentary, Leni Riefenstahl addresses her past for the first time on camera.

Length: 3:01   Rating: NR

English and German with English Subtitles

List Price: $29.95 | Our Price: $22.00 

 
While she never actually joined the Nazi Party, as the creator of the single most effective propaganda film ever made, Triumph of the Will, Riefenstahl has spent much of her life trying to live down her association with the Third Reich. Her personal relationship with Hitler is still in question.

Feisty and charismatic at 91, Riefenstahl revisits the landmarks of her turbulent life -- from her beginnings as a daredevil actress in German ""mountain films"" to her direction of such stunning narratives as The Blue Light (1932) and Tiefland (1940s, released in 1954), to her infamous, brilliant documentaries Triumph of the Will (1935) and Olympia (1938), to her anthropological photographs of the now extinct Nuba tribes in Africa. The film brings the story of Riefenstahl right up to her current passion, scuba diving and shooting films of exotic aquatic life. All together, a riveting story that leaves the viewer in total awe of its controversial subject.
 
Critical Acclaim:

""A vital artistic event! One of the year's ten best."" - Richard Corliss, Time

""Staggering. The most fascinating, weirdly engaging monster ever recorded on film."" - Joan Juliet Buck

336,cl4B9AU45P4,Philadelphia (1993) - Movie Trailer,"With Hanks, who is always watchable, and Washington, who has also got a very good track record, this film was destined to be fantastic but not even I, who always has an optimistic view when it comes to movies, was ready for the impact that this film made. Tom Hanks excelled even himself with his performance as an AIDS striken homosexual who is fired from his job simply because of his condition. It is Hanks, by himself, who makes the whole scenario in the film believable. Although this is Hanks's best performance of his career, he is very closely followed by Denzel Washington who gives a perfect performance as the only lawyer who will take on the case although he is a homophobe himself. The emotional strain of the film on the audience is immense and in the later stages of the film it is almost impossible to watch because of that. The make-up which gives the impression that Hanks really does have the terrible disease is perfect and the simple yet striking direction from Jonathan Demme(The Silence Of The Lambs) make this utterly compelling viewing although at times it is very uncomfortable. All praise to everyone in the making of this beautiful film.

As pent-up emotions of rage and desire swirl around all three characters, the savage wilderness begins to consume the tiny European enclave.

This has been linked on many sites as ""representing the real movie,"" when it doesn't. I'm posting this message to let others who wish to embed this know that this isn't the real trailer. In fact, a few contradictions to the actual movie plot are played on. 

For those of you who are fans of ""The Three Musketeers"" (Chris O'Donnell; Kiefer Sutherland), I've created a recut trailer making the musketeers slightly more ""bad-ass"", who fight the king. Cardinal Richelieu tries to protect the king from the rogue musketeers, making him a good guy.

Note that this is my first non-horror/thriller recut, rather a redo trailer with a lot of twists to the old story. The action (I hope) will make up for the lack of the horror feel.

Also, I guarantee that there is no other trailer like this one for this movie anywhere. You might even feel like watching the real movie after viewing this. Of course, all credit would go to Disney and Caravan for producing this fun film. Enjoy!",124537,121,20,PT2M56S,0

389,F1os6UU6jhU,Terminator 2: Judgement Day - Official Movie Trailer,"A sequel to the sci-fi action thriller that made him and star Arnold Schwarzenegger A-list Hollywood names, writer/director James Cameron upped the ante with this follow-up by employing a more sweeping storyline and cutting-edge special effects. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor (Edward Furlong), during the late nineties. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about humankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps break Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two Terminators at a steel foundry. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which won four Oscars in technical categories for its groundbreaking effects, was followed by a short sequel filmed exclusively as an attraction for theme parks, Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time (1996). - Karl Williams, Rovi

390,J0obOvGGb1U,Dances With Wolves - Official® Trailer [HD],"Release Date: November 21, 1990

A historical drama about the relationship between a Civil War soldier and a band of Sioux Indians, Kevin Costner's directorial debut was also a surprisingly popular hit, considering its length, period setting, and often somber tone. The film opens on a particularly dark note, as melancholy Union lieutenant John W. Dunbar attempts to kill himself on a suicide mission, but instead becomes an unintentional hero.

His actions lead to his reassignment to a remote post in remote South Dakota, where he encounters the Sioux. Attracted by the natural simplicity of their lifestyle, he chooses to leave his former life behind to join them, taking on the name Dances with Wolves. Soon, Dances with Wolves has become a welcome member of the tribe and fallen in love with a white woman who has been raised amongst the tribe.

His peaceful existence is threatened, however, when Union soldiers arrive with designs on the Sioux land.

The film has won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Tom (David Schwimmer) freaks out when his high school crush, Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), shows up, and hassles Scott (Michael Vartan) for his shirt.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This dark comedy is a clever homage to classic generation gap comedies such as The Graduate (1967), The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Big Chill (1983), filtered through an ironic Generation X lens. Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is unemployed and aimless, hovering between childhood and adult responsibilities. A year out of college, Tom can't land a decent job -- he still lives with his mother in Brooklyn. He receives a call from Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), who informs Tom that her son Bill, Tom's best friend in high school, has killed himself. She wants Tom to deliver the eulogy and serve as a pallbearer, and flustered, Tom agrees, though he has no recollection of Bill. After delivering a lackluster eulogy, Tom meets the grieving Ruth and begins an impulsive affair with her. He also encounters Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful classmate for whom he's long carried a torch. Although Julie at first mistakes Tom for someone else, they begin dating, while he keeps his relationship with Ruth a secret. First-time writer-director Matt Reeves work-shopped the script for The Pallbearer with writing partner Jason Katims at the Sundance Institute. Reeves went on to create the TV series Felicity.

Angus is fat, dorky and smart, a kid with an uncool pal and a crush on a cheerleader. Angus is funny, rowdy and triumphant, a totally cool movie with a dead-on eye and ear for the hilarious, heartbreaking rite of passage called high school. A great cast (including Academy Award® winners* George C. Scott and Kathy Bates as Anguss oddball family) sparks this story about what happens when Angus is named King of the Winter Ball as a prank and how he turns humiliation into victory. Angus, Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, delivers a rousing up yours to all the snotty high school golden boys [and] a climax that I, for one, found wholly the equal of anything in Rocky.

Directed By Patrick Read Johnson
Starring Charlie Talbert, George C. Scott, Kathy Bates

Dead Man (1995) Official Trailer - Johnny Depp Movie HD

Dead Man is the story of a young man's journey, both physically and spiritually, into very unfamiliar terrain. William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named ""Nobody,"" who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side.

The Captain and Sarah are pulled apart by the war's undertow into choices they can not fully control or understand. Each character in this drama must decide whether loyalty will be paid in blood. This story has a relevance to current partisan conflicts. Armies are not filled with murdering psychopaths. Good people can be driven to do bad things. The story chronicles the pathology of war, how escalating events can trigger unasked-for tragedy. Based on a true story about a southern child who shot and killed a union soldier during the Civil War.

60 years after it swept the Oscars, Minnelli's dazzling dance extravaganza returns to the screen with a new digitally restored print.

Gene Kelly is at his toe-tapping best as Jerry Mulligan, a former GI who dreams of finding success as an artist.  A chance encounter with shopgirl Lise (Leslie Caron), however, throws his life into a whirlwind of romantic roundabouts.  Featuring the uplifting number, 'I Got Rhythm', and a spectacular ballet finale played out to Gershwin's titular score, An American in Paris remains one of the finest examples of the musical form.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Regina (Audrey Hepburn) flees with Peter (Cary Grant) away from greedy pursuers after her dead husband's fortune.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn star in this stylish comedy-thriller directed by Stanley Donen, very much in a Hitchcock vein. Grant plays Peter Joshua, who meets Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) in Paris and later offers to help her when she discovers that her husband has been murdered. After the funeral, Reggie is summoned to the embassy and warned by agent/friend Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) that her late husband helped steal 250,000 dollars during the war and that the rest of the gang is after the money as well. When three of the men who attended her husband's funeral begin to harass her, Reggie goes to Joshua for help, at which time Joshua confesses that his name is actually Alexander Dyle, the brother of a fourth accomplice in the gold theft. The three men from the funeral are revealed to be the three other accomplices in the crime, and though she knows next to nothing of the heist, Reggie is caught in a ring of suspense as she is followed by the shadowy trio, all after the money. Apparently, the only person she can trust is Joshua/Dyle -- until Bartholomew tells Reggie that the fourth accomplice had no brother, and Joshua/Dyle reveals that he is, in fact, a crook named Adam Canfield. Now Reggie doesn't know where to turn. The musical score by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini was nominated for an Academy Award.

This ectoplasmic romance between Gene Tierney (as the most beautiful spinster ever to don a shawl and wire-rim glasses) and Rex Harrison as the sea-faring ghost who loves her is a match not made in heaven but certainly headed there. Bernard Herrmann’s wistful score is the finishing touch on one of the greatest date-night movies ever.

607,zaC2bWF60A8,Joe Dante on TO BE OR NOT TO BE,"Jack Benny's greatest movie role, and no wonder--it was written especially for him by Ernst Lubitsch! Carole Lombard's swan song earned her some of her finest reviews posthumously, but the film itself, daringly dark for the time, was generally regarded as an insensitive and even troubling satire of wartime issues. The title refers not only to Shakespeare but the questionable existence of Poland. It has since been recognized as one of the director's finest efforts and a brilliantly cast comedy classic. Remade in 1983 with Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft in the leads.

Penny Serenade (1941)
Η.Π.Α. - Ασπρόμαυρη - 119'

Μια ιστορία για όσους έχουν αγαπήσει...
και για εκείνους που δεν έχουν,
αλλά ελπίζουν να αγαπήσουν.

Μια συναισθηματική ταινία με στιγμές σπαρακτικού πάθος και γέλιου.

Τα μεγάλα όνειρα ενός ζευγαριού δίνουν τη θέση τους σε μια ζωή
γεμάτη από απροσδόκητη θλίψη και απρόσμενη χαρά.

Η εξαιρετική ηθοποιία του Κάρι Γκραντ και της Αϊρίν Νταν
προσδίδουν στην ταινία μια ιδιαίτερη ποιότητα.

Η Τζούλι είναι έτοιμη να εγκαταλείψει τον σύζυγο της, Ρότζερ, όταν βάζει συγκεκριμένες ηχογραφήσεις που θυμίζουν γεγονότα από την μεταξύ τους ζωή. Ένα από αυτά είναι το τραγούδι που ακούσαν όταν πρωτογνωρίστηκαν σε μαγαζί δίσκων. 

Ένα βήμα πριν εγκαταλείψει τον σύζυγο της, η Τζούλι ακούει τις μελωδίες που έχει συλλέξει και κάθε τραγούδι της θυμίζει ένα στάδιο της ζωής τους μαζί ...

Monty Python delivers the group's sharpest and smartest satire of both religion and Hollywood's epic films.  Set in 33 A.D. Judea where the exasperated Romans try to impose order, it is a time of chaos and change with no shortage of messiahs and follwers willing to belive in them.  At its center is Brian Cohen, born in Bethleham in a stable next door, who, by a series of absurd circumstances is caught up in the new religion and reluctantly mistaken for the promised messiah, providing ample opportunity for the entire ensemble (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) to shine in mulitple roles as they question everyone and everything from ex-lepers, Pontius Pilate and haggling to revolutionaries, crazy prophets, religious fanaticism, Roman centurions and crucifixion, forever changing our biblical view.",746354,1956,115,PT2M51S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
After a simple jewelery heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In 1992, Reservoir Dogs transformed Quentin Tarantino practically overnight from an obscure, unproduced screenwriter and part-time actor to the most influential new filmmaker of the 1990s. The story looks at what happens before and after (but not during) a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the rat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana.

Critical reaction was mixed and the box-office weak, but all of Oliver Stone’s films are passion projects and The Doors is no different: like Morrison himself, Stone’s movie is never dull or doctrinaire.

706,4wBUnziyPWQ,John Landis on GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS,"Director James Foley’s adaptation of David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize winning play was a box office flop but has gained in stature due to its remarkable cast and viciously funny set-pieces  (Alec Baldwin’s “Always Be Closing” is kissing cousin to Gordon Gecko’s “Greed is Good”). The pressure cooker plot about four real estate agents fighting for their jobs in a claustrophobic Chicago office space is punctuated by Mamet’s memorably mean-spirited dialogue which is delivered by some of the finest actors of the time including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin and Ed Harris. Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and Lemmon was voted Best Actor by the National Board of Review.

Probably the best known of all the screen adaptations of Tennessee Williams' plays, this is also one of the finest, thanks partly to the intensely claustrophobic hot-house atmosphere created by Elia Kazan's intimate direction, and partly to the young Marlon Brando's trademark blend of subtle detail and charismatic power.

The Funeral is a 1996 American crime-drama film directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Annabella Sciorra, Isabella Rossellini, Vincent Gallo, Benicio del Toro and Gretchen Mol.

The story concerns the funeral of one of three brothers in a family of gangsters that lived in New York in 1930s. It is a film that details the past of the brothers and their families through a series of flashbacks. The film is most notable for its shocking climax.

Chris Penn won the best supporting actor award at the 1996 Venice Film Festival for his performance.

Plot:

The film begins with the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers. These men are violent criminals. Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating. Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks show us that Johnny was more sensitive. Exposure to Communist meetings as a spy sway Johnny's opinions.

The chief suspect in Johnny's murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.

Ray and Chez swear revenge. Ray's wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez' wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband's obsessive nature.

As it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who first claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend, but who later admits, just before Ray kills him, that he wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends.

As he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers' lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray's house and shoots Ray's bodyguards, shoots his dead brother Johnny lying in the casket, shoots Ray, and then puts the gun in his own mouth and commits suicide as the family women wail over Ray as he too dies.",78546,263,43,PT2M21S,0

723,o-085q_GK5E,Plutonium Circus - documentary,"Directed by George Ratliff.

Funny yet incisive look at the PANTEX Nuclear Weapons Plant, in Amarillo, TX, which was used for nuclear weapons assembly during the Cold War. The plant, which provides most of the jobs for those living in Amarillo, now operates as a disassembly-line where the weapons, which were once built there, are now being taken apart with the plutonium getting stored underground. The film deals with the issues of storing the plutonium and the effects the plant has had (and is having) on the town of Amarillo, as well as how it has affected the way people thought about the Cold War and its aftermath. It does so by taking a look at the lives and activities of the Amarillo residents directly or indirectly associated with, or having strong opinions about the Plant. Written by Tamas Kovacs (stargazer at howler.sps.mot.com)

Those sailors vowed to return and that’s just what they do, using the fog that blankets this little seaside town as their method of transportation. Starring Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh, the film was a solid success bringing in nearly $22 million on its $1 million budget. The Fog was remade in 2005, directed by Rupert Wainwright and starring Selma Blair.

Bob Roberts Trailer - Directed by Tim Robbins and starring Tim Robbins, Giancarlo Esposito, Alan Rickman, Ray Wise, Brian Murray. Mock documentary about an upstart candidate for the U.S. Senate written and directed by actor Tim Robbins. Bob Roberts is a folksinger with a difference: He offers tunes that protest welfare chiselers, liberal whining, and the like. As the filmmakers follow his campaign, Robbins gives needle-sharp insight into the way candidates manipulate the media.

753,drys1OnF35E,PATHS OF GLORY New Original Masters of Cinema Trailer,"Here is the all-new original Masters of Cinema trailer for PATHS OF GLORY!

A shattering masterpiece by one of the medium’s greatest artists, Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory announced the definitive arrival of a towering figure in cinema.

In the French front lines of World War I, after giving the order for an impossible and disastrous mission to capture a nearby stronghold, the upper ranks move to save face by having three randomly selected soldiers held and tried for cowardice under pain of death. Their leader, Colonel Dax (in a powerhouse performance by Kirk Douglas) a former lawyer in civilian life, handles their defence against overwhelming odds.

A stylistically astonishing, emotionally overwhelming anti-war drama, Paths of Glory is one of the screen’s most brilliant condemnations of the power structures guiding warfare. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present a new Blu-ray edition for the first time in the UK from 19 Sept 2016.

Spielberg’s brilliant staging of the familiar clichés from those beloved b-movies gave them a new lease on life and captivated younger audiences who showed up to the theaters in droves. Starring Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, the bookish archaeologist and sometime action hero with a pathological fear of snakes (of course there are many snakes in this film). John Williams contributed the rousing score and Douglas Slocombe provided immaculate widescreen photography fit for a David Lean epic.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Colonel Shaw (Matthew Broderick) leads his company at the battle of Antietam.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the Civil War. Simply put, the heroes involved have been ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, headed by Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers are denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; as in armies past and future, they are given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. Still, none of the soldiers quit the regiment when given the chance. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner, SC, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. Glory was based on Lincoln Kirstein's Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard's One Gallant Rush; the latter book was founded on the letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the real-life character played by Matthew Broderick. The film won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for co-star Denzel Washington, and additional statuettes for Best Cinematography (Freddie Francis) and Sound Recording.

805,gFCaDFAKNlk,Touch of Evil (New Trailer) - In cinemas 10 July | BFI release,"Here’s our brand new trailer for Orson Welles’ noir masterpiece Touch of Evil, which returns to cinemas across the UK from 10 July.
Subscribe: http://bit.ly/subscribetotheBFI.

Book tickets here: http://bit.ly/1A3veVc
For more information on the nationwide release click here

http://www.bfi.org.uk/whats-on/bfi-film-releases/touch-evil

“A brilliant fusion of pulp art with continental sophistication; it has all the energetic cruddiness of a Sammy Fuller ‘B’ picture, and all the self-consciousness of a New Wave melodrama.”
James Naremore, The Magic World of Orson Welles, 1978

Charlton Heston (starring here as Mexican border cop Mike Vargas) was apparently instrumental in persuading B-movie producer Albert Zugsmith to hire Orson Welles – who hadn’t directed in Hollywood for a decade – to make Touch of Evil.

Beginning with one of the most celebrated tracking shots in cinema history, a bravura three-minute take in which a bomb is planted in a car that then explodes after crossing the US border, Welles created a baroque, highly stylised masterpiece from inauspiciously pulpy source material.

With its story of murder, marijuana and police corruption, Touch of Evil is considered among the last of the 1940s/50s cycle of crime thrillers known as film noir. Welles’ vivid turn as corpulent bent cop Quinlan provided one of the genre’s most memorable villains.

Iniquity south of the border also colours Welles’ prior film noir, The Lady from Shanghai (1947), starring his then-wife Rita Hayworth.

Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of modern horror is widely considered to be the most terrifying movie of all time.

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel, this tale of a family man and would-be writer (Jack Nicholson) going mad as winter caretaker of the cursed Overlook Hotel is a seminal work of the genre. It is also, as Martin Scorsese has pointed out, like no other horror film ever made -- 'essentially unclassifiable, endlessly provocative and profoundly disturbing'. The BFI will release a magnificent new digital transfer from Warner Bros. of the US version which has never before been released in the UK and which -- at 144 minutes -- runs 24 minutes longer than the European version previously seen.

Promoted to Lieutenant General, Patton is sent to Sicily, where he engages in a personal war of egos with British Field Marshal Montgomery. Performing brilliantly in Italy, Patton seriously jeopardizes his future with a single slap. While touring an Army hospital, the General comes across a GI suffering from nervous fatigue. Incensed by what he considers a slacker, Patton smacks the poor soldier and orders him to get well in a hurry. This incident results in his losing his command-and, by extension, missing out on D-Day. In his final campaign, Patton leads the US 3rd Army through Europe. Unabashedly flamboyant, Patton remains a valuable resource, but ultimately proves too much of a ""loose cannon"" in comparison to the more level-headed tactics of his old friend Omar Bradley.",675518,1164,211,PT4M39S,0

Night on Earth is a 1991 film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. It is a collection of five vignettes, taking place during the same night, concerning the temporary bond formed between taxi driver and passenger in five cities: Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. Jarmusch wrote the screenplay in about eight days, and the choice of certain cities was largely based on the actors with whom he wanted to work.[1] The soundtrack of the same name is by Tom Waits.",399484,2054,111,PT2M24S,0

Watch your back as the trendsetters of Westerberg High School are chewing up the scenery and may just have you in their evil sights in this razor-sharp black comedy about peer group peril. Up to her neck in vitriol and sick of it, popular teenager Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder, Edward Scissorhands) finds herself in a tiresome tide of ins and outs, part of a cruel social clique so wrapped up in their own making that no one else stands a chance. She decides to challenge the malevolent rule of the self-appointed divas of the school scene, the Heathers (Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker), and begins a torrid journey of blackmail, sex, revenge and murder. With the aid of rebellious newcomer Jason Dean (Christian Slater, True Romance) Veronica is set to revolutionise the classroom and turn popular perception upside down. Heathers, the original '80s cult classic, returns us to a time of 'swatch dogs', 'diet coke heads' and a bunch of croquet playing queen bees that will have you laughing to the last despicable gasp. Lick it up baby, and get in line, because 'bulimia is so '87!'",108130,903,37,PT1M48S,0

Or in this case, the lack of personality: as Chance, a gentle shut-in untouched by the outside world except for what little knowledge he’s gleaned from TV, Sellers turns in a studious portrait of a completely vacant man. Directed by Hal Ashby from Jerzy Kozinski’s 1970 novel, the film co-stars Shirley MacLaine, Jack Warden and, in an Oscar-winning performance, Melvyn Douglas.

Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins star in director Francis Ford Coppola's visually stunning, passionately seductive version of the classic Dracula legend. In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Coppola returns to the original source of the Dracula myth, and from that gothic romance, he creates a modern masterpiece. Gary Oldman's metamorphosis as Dracula who grows from old to young, from man to beast is nothing short of amazing. Winona Ryder brings equal intensity to the role of a young beauty who becomes the object of Dracula's devastating desire. Anthony Hopkins co-stars as the famed doctor who dares to believe in Dracula, and then dares to confront him. Opulent, dazzling and utterly irresistible, this is Dracula as you've never seen him. And once you've seen Bram Stoker's Dracula, you'll never forget it.

Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive), goaded by an even madder scientist (Ernest Thesinger), builds his monster(Boris Karloff) a mate (Elsa Lanchester).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This greatest of all Frankenstein movies begins during a raging thunderstorm. Warm and cozy inside their palatial villa, Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon), Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton), and Shelley's wife Mary (Elsa Lanchester) engage in morbidly sparkling conversation. The wicked Byron mockingly chastises Mary for frightening the literary world with her recent novel Frankenstein, but Mary insists that her horror tale preached a valuable moral, that man was not meant to dabble in the works of God. Moreover, Mary adds that her story did not end with the death of Frankenstein's monster, whereupon she tells the enthralled Byron and Shelley what happened next. Surviving the windmill fire that brought the original 1931 Frankenstein to a close, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly revives and goes on another rampage of death and destruction. Meanwhile, his ailing creator Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) discovers that his former mentor, the demented Doctor Praetorius (Ernst Thesiger), plans to create another life-sized monster -- this time a woman! After a wild and wooly ""creation"" sequence, the bandages are unwrapped, and the Bride of the Monster (Elsa Lanchester again) emerges. Alas, the Monster's tender efforts to connect with his new Mate are rewarded only by her revulsion and hoarse screams. ""She hate me,"" he growls, ""Just like others!"" Wonderfully acted and directed, The Bride of Frankenstein is further enhanced by the vivid Franz Waxman musical score; even the film's occasional lapses in logic and continuity (it was trimmed from 90 to 75 minutes after the first preview) are oddly endearing. Director James Whale was memorably embodied by Ian McKellen in the Oscar-winning 1998 biopic Gods and Monsters.

A naive woman living in a remote Calvinist community on the Scottish coast, Bess (Emily Watson in an Academy Award® nominated performance) flaunts the will of the town's austere churchmen to marry Jan (Stellan Skarsgård, Good Will Hunter) a lusty Swede working in a nearby offshore oil rig. Her purity is put to the ultimate test when Jan is crippled in an accident and she agrees to continue their love-making vicariously through other men. Pilloried as a harlot, Bess is committed to the asylum but not before she seeks Jan's recovery through one final act of faith. Captured through Robby Mueller's (Paris, Texas) raw, relentless hand-held camera, this triumphant tale of tragedy, faith and redemption - the first in Lars Von Trier's ""Golden Heart"" trilogy on saintly heroines book-ended by Dancer in the Dark - is a cinematic tour de force.",125136,414,24,PT2M10S,0

943,rsBx_eTVSpQ,Donnie Brasco Trailer [HD],"Donnie Brasco - You may not notice the HD quality, but there is a bit diffrence. I personally love this movie, and therefore I got the trailer and batched it to HD quality. I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, i got the orginal DVD, and i promise you.. It´s worth buying. I´ll give it 6 stars.. It´s brilliant acting, great plot.. I´ve seen it 20 times +, and I´ll never stop watching it.

Donnie Brasco is an Academy Awardnominated 1997 film by Mike Newell, starring Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Johnny Depp. It is loosely based on the real-life events of Joseph D. Pistone, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who successfully infiltrated the Bonanno crime family, one of the Mafia's Five Families based in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias ""Donnie Brasco"". Depp met with Pistone several times while preparing for his role.

In the late 1970s, FBI agent Joe Pistone (Depp) is assigned to infiltrate the New York Citybased Bonanno crime family. Calling himself, ""Donnie Brasco"" and posing as a diamond expert from Vero Beach, Florida, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino), a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters, and Dominick ""Sonny Black"" Napolitano (Madsen). Lefty can't seem to make any money, his son is a drug-addict and he is continually passed over for promotion to a higher position within the crime family. He continually reminds Brasco of his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years in the Mafia (and killing 26 people), with little to show for it. In Donnie, however, Lefty sees a young protégé who might be able to succeed where he had failed. He takes Donnie under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly becomes accepted by the other Family members, although he is never elevated above the rank of ""associate"" member (the lowest mafia rank). But the longer Pistone plays the role of a gangster, the more he finds himself actually becoming Donnie Brasco during his rare off duty hours. His change in personality drives a wedge between him and his wife (played by Anne Heche) and three children. Over time, Pistone comes to realize that the slightest mistake in his performance as a mobster could result in the death of him and his family. In addition, Joe Pistone has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend. He knows that when the day finally comes that the FBI arrests his mob associates, he will be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he himself had killed him.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Adapted Screenplay

A film is planned but is stymied by casting problems; a play is produced in Sarajevo, but the actors are swept away by war; the Director is frustrated in completing the film that initially couldn't get off the ground; and the magnificence of Mozart puts a period to Godard's wandering--but never adrift--drama. Woven into the fabric of FOR EVER MOZART are examinations of the tools humankind uses to craft truth and beauty out of chaos: art, politics, movies, every kind of ""framed"" image of ourselves and our experiences. -- Film Society of Lincoln Center",20425,108,4,PT1M41S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A comic book artist (Ben Affleck) falls in love with a woman (Joey Lauren Adams) before finding out that she is a lesbian.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After a pair of films about hipster slackers, the work of writer-director Kevin Smith matured and gained critical respect with this low budget, independent comedy-drama about love, sex and the fine line between the two. Ben Affleck stars as Holden McNeil, a New Jersey comic book writer who is roommates with his best friend and professional partner, artist Banky Edwards (Jason Lee). Their hit comic book series, ""Bluntman and Chronic,"" is loosely patterned after a pair of acquaintances, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Smith), two characters already familiar as supporting players in several Smith films. Into Holden's life comes Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a lesbian and fellow comic book creator who quickly becomes a close friend, although Holden is powerfully attracted to her. Eventually, Alyssa realizes that she is attracted to Holden as well and they begin a physical relationship, much to the consternation of Banky, whose ire over losing his best friend to a lesbian seems to border on romantic jealousy. After he learns something about Alyssa's sexual past, however, Holden's immature response to his new knowledge destroys both his romance with Alyssa and his friendship with Banky. Chasing Amy (1997) was the third film in what Smith referred to as his ""New Jersey series,"" films set at least partly in the Garden State and featuring the Jay and Silent Bob characters.

1050,EcWK0M4VMjA,'I Know What You Did Last Summer' - Trailer (1997),"WARNING! SPOILERS IN DESCRIPTION!

Directed By: Jim Gillespie
Starring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Johnny Galecki, Bridgette Wilson, Anne Heche, Muse Watson

Plot:
The night of their high school graduation, Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Philippe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr) go out of town to celebrate. Returning in Barry's new car, they hit and apparently kill a man. They dump the corpse in the ocean and agree to never discuss again what had happened.
One year later Julie is returning home from college. She has not spoken with Helen, Barry or Ray since the accident. Julie receives a letter that reads ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!"" Julie goes to see Helen's sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson), who tells Julie that Helen has been working there. Julie shows Helen the letter and they decide to visit Barry. After going over the incident, Barry accuses Max. The three of them go to see Max, but Barry insists on going in the factory alone. Barry persuades Max to go into the back room and attacks him, telling Max he should keep his mouth shut. Julie finds Ray working on the docks. Ray tries to make up with Julie but she runs off. Inside the factory Max is murdered by someone wielding a hook. The killer attacks Barry next, running him over with Barry's car. The killer is shown wearing a raincoat and wielding a hook on one hand.
Julie arrives at the hospital to see Barry and finds Helen and Ray there. Julie reveals the man they hit was named David Eagen. Helen and Julie track his sister, Missy (Anne Heche), to her home, where she has been living since her brother's death. Missy does not recognise them and Julie is convinced she is innocent. Missy tells them she had a visit from a man claiming to be David's friend named Billy Blue.
At Helen's home that night, the killer breaks in, hiding in her closet. The next morning Helen wakes up with most of her hair cut to bits and ""SOON"" written in lipstick on her mirror. Julie gets a call from Barry, who tells her to come to Helen's. On the way, Julie hears rattling in her trunk. She opens the trunk to find Max's body. She shuts the trunk, runs to Helen's and brings her and Barry to her car, but the body has disappeared. Julie is convinced the killer took the body and they are not safe. Later they run into Ray, who tells them he got a letter. Julie decides to see Missy again while Helen and Barry watch each other's backs at the parade. Julie tries to convince Missy that David did not kill himself after Missy presents her with a suicide note written in the same style as her letter from the killer. Missy tells Julie to leave.
At the Croaker pageant, Helen sees Barry murdered by the killer. However, neither the killer nor the body are found afterwards. A police officer drives her home, but the killer lures the cop into an alley and kills him. Helen runs to her store where Elsa is working, but the killer finds and murders both of them.
Julie learns that the killer is Ben Willis, a fisherman. He murdered David Egan after David and Ben's daughter Susie were involved in a car crash near where the four teenagers hit Ben. Susie was killed in the accident and David was unharmed. Ben blamed David and killed him a year later, making it look like a suicide. On the way home, Ben was hit by the group.
Julie goes to see Ray on his boat and tells him the story, but he does not believe her. Julie notices the name on his boat is ""Billy Blue"" and accuses him of the murders. He chases her but is knocked unconscious by a man who tells Julie to get on his boat. After she does, she learns he is Ben Willis. She is chased all over the boat while Ray regains consciousness and steals a boat to save Julie. In a room full of ice, Julie finds Helen and Barry's bodies. Ray climbs aboard and is almost killed by Ben, but is caught in the boat's net. He climbs back aboard and saves Julie. Ben gets his hand caught in a rope and Ray hoists him into the air where his hand is cut off and he falls into the ocean. On land, Ray tells Julie the reason he went to see Missy was because he was guilty and had to know who they hit. He tells her he loves her and they embrace. Ben's body is not recovered.
A year later, Julie is in her second year and is going on a trip to New York with Ray. She receives a letter resembling the one she had got from Ben, but it only contains a pool party invitation. Julie returns to the bathroom, which has filled with steam. On the shower door, ""I STILL KNOW"" is written. Ben jumps through the shower door, attacking her.",1464930,3344,665,PT2M19S,0

Eddie Adams would have been just another high-school drop-out had he not met the likes of adult film director Jack Horner. Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift. Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the film is a tribute to the decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era. Everyone's born with one special thing, and Eddie Adams uses his humongous ""asset"" to take the world of film pornography by storm. Things get ugly though when success leads to drugs and ruin.

Director: Peter Weir
Starring: Jim Carrey, Ed Harris and Laura Linney.

Nominated for 3 Oscars, including Best Director and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ed Harris)

The Truman Show is a 1998 American satirical comedy-drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol. The cast includes Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, as well as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone. The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast 24-hours-a-day to billions of people across the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.

The genesis of The Truman Show was a spec script by Niccol. The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script, and instantly set the project up at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was in contention to direct before Weir took over, managing to make the film for $60 million against the estimated $80 million budget. Niccol rewrote the script simultaneously as the filmmakers were waiting for Carrey's schedule to open up for filming. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.

The film was a financial and critical success, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards and The Saturn Awards. The Truman Show has been analyzed as a thesis on Christianity, simulated reality, existentialism and the rise of reality television.

Plot:
An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A female flight attendant (Pam Grier) becomes a key figure in a plot between the police and an arms dealer.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed this adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1995 Rum Punch, switching the action from Miami to LA, and altering the central character from white to black. Ruthless arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), who lives with perpetually stoned beach-babe Melanie (Bridget Fonda), teams with his old buddy Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), just released from prison after serving four years for armed robbery. ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) bust stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), who was smuggling money into the country for Ordell. Ordell springs Jackie, but when middle-aged bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) picks her up at the jail, he's attracted to her, and they choose a romantic route with detours. Mistrust and suspicions surface after Jackie pits Ordell and the cops against each other, convincing Ordell that she's going to double-cross the cops. Tarantino commented on the film's budget: ""Jackie Brown only cost $12 million. You can't lose. You absolutely, positively can't lose. And you don't have to compromise.""

Interweaving dream logic with satire, melodrama, surrealism, and everyday reality, it dives headfirst into the craziness and contradictions of sexual relations between men and women, and the soulful search for understanding and love.",10771,13,0,PT3M16S,0

Director: Randall Wallace
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, Gérard Depardieu and John Malkovich.

The Man in the Iron Mask is a 1998 British/American historical action film directed, produced, and written by Randall Wallace. It uses characters from Alexandre Dumas' D'Artagnan Romances, and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. It also bears several similarities with the 1939 film version. The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film.

Plot: 
The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king?

The four-inch-tall Clock family secretly share a house with the normal-sized Lender family, ""borrowing"" such items as thread, safety pins, batteries and scraps of food.

Entstanden aus dem ""Duke Ellington""-Projekt des Jazzorchesters der Kölner Musikhochschule hatte die Band nach ihrer Gründung im Frühjahr 1996 einen ungewöhnliche erfolgreichen Start. Im April 1996 nahm die Band auf Einladung von Manfred Schoof an dessen Geburtstagskonzert in der Philharmonie Köln teil, und spielte mit Rob Pronk, Ali Haurand, Gerd Dudek, Gunther Hampel und Markus Stockhausen (TV-Aufzeichnung WDR: ""Manfred Schoof - Weggefährten"").
Das Orchester hat unter der Leitung von Stefan Pfeifer bei Projekten mit Gastsolisten wie u.a. Conte Candoli, Ack van Rooyen, Al Porcino, Dick Oates, Ferdinand Povel, Heinz von Hermann, Silvia Droste, Andy Haderer, Jörg-Achim Keller, Jiggs Whigham und Ed Partyka sein hohes Niveau und seine musikalische Flexibilität unter Beweis gestellt. Die Mitglieder des Orchesters sind ausnahmslos hervorragende professionelle Musiker, die sowohl als Solisten wie als Sidemen in den unterschiedlichsten Bereichen der Musik erfolgreich tätig sind.
Das umfangreiche Bandbook umfasst unter anderem Arrangements von Bill Holman, Bob Florence, John Clayton, Don Menza, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Stan Kenton, Maynard Ferguson, Francy Boland, Jerry van Rooyen und Rob Pronk ebenso wie Musik aus den Reihen der Band. Dieses Repertoire, interpretiert mit der Leidenschaft, der Perfektion und dem mitreißenden Swing einer glänzend eingespielten Band mit ihren herausragenden Solisten, macht den Sound der ""Big Band Convention"" aus.
Das Orchester begann seine Konzerte 1996 zunächst im Stadtgarten in Köln und setzte diese mit großem Erfolg zwischen 1998 und 2003 im Rheinländer in Köln fort. Dort entstand auch die CD ""Live At The Rheinländer Cologne 2001"". Nach weiteren Stationen im Kunstsalon, Altenberger Hof, Subway und im Bogen 2 in der Hohenzollernbrücke in Köln spielt ""The Big Band Convention"" im Klub Berlin, Keplerstr. 4, 50823 Köln

Michael Bay (The Rock) directed this science fiction action thriller in the When Worlds Collide tradition. After astronomy students discover a comet-asteroid collision, an asteroid fragment ""the size of the Super Dome"" threatens. It's destroyed by a secret USA defense in space, but a large chunk veers off toward Singapore. With another asteroid ""the size of Texas"" en route, a plan is devised to send oil drillers to land on the asteroid and drop a nuclear device down a 1000-foot shaft, a scheme calculated to crack the asteroid into two halves, saving Earth. NASA begins a crash program to train beer-besotted oil roughnecks for the mission. During a stopover to refuel at the Mir Station, the space station is accidentally destroyed, so a Russian cosmonaut also joins the team. Produced by Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer (Con Air), and Gale Anne Hurd (The Relic, The Abyss).

DP Karl Freund suggested the indelible concluding butterfly sequence. Star Lew Ayres, a genuine pacifist whose career suffered a decade later, served selflessly in WW II in noncombat positions.

Chariots of Fire tells the story of two very different men who compete as runners in the 1924 Paris Olympics: 

Eric Liddell is a devout Christian who believes that his athletic abilities are a gift from God, and that using that gift to its fullest extent - to win the gold medal - will be his way of repaying that gift. 

Harold Abrahams is an English Jew, a student at Cambridge, who dreams of fame and of proving to his anti-Semitic fellow students, and to the world, that Jews are in no respect inferior. 
Their motives are noble. Their commitment is total. Their integrity is unquestionable. They will both make personal sacrifices to achieve their goals. In the process, through all the obstacles and personal issues they conquer, they prove that striving for victory in their own terms is, perhaps, its own reward. 

Based on a true story, CHARIOTS OF FIRE was the winner of four Academy Awards®, including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, in addition to receiving nominations for three more.

Repo Man:
The cult classic from 1984, Repo Man is a dark, post-apocalyptic comedy thriller centred on two car repossession men making fast bucks in the seamy, seedy LA underworld. 

Otto (Emilio Estevez - The Breakfast Club) is an alienated punk wandering the LA streets before a coke-sniffing Bud (Harry Dean Stanton - Paris, Texas), an aging repossession man, offers him money to drive a car out of a bad neighbourhood. 

Soon enough, Otto is earning big money under Bud's tutelage but their latest repo job lands them in hot water when a nuclear physicist leaves something toxic - a nuclear device, an alien? - in the trunk of a 1964 Chevy... As the acerbic Bud advises his apprentice: ''A repo man's life is always intense.'' Well remembered for its bizarre, eccentric characters and dystopic vision of America, director Alex Cox's (Sid and Nancy - 1986) fresh and darkly humorous urban fable is rounded out by a classic theme song from Iggy Pop.",5251,24,2,PT29S,0

Inaccuracies
The movie incorrectly presents many aspects of Polish culture. Czarnina (duck blood soup) although very popular until the 19th century is rarely eaten now. Kielbasa (sausage), especially cooked is rarely consumed for breakfast, while each meal in the movie contains it. Music played in the film is of Balcan origin. Procession of the Virgin and selection of a virgin to lead it does not happen in the Polish Roman Catholic church. The movie plays off a number of inaccurate stereotypes. Obsession over a large number of offspring is perhaps a 19th century phenomenon, while smoking and shouting at the table are not accepted in Polish culture.",99435,102,31,PT1M29S,0
1295,Nmb1g4SYIM0,"5 Minute Features: This World, Then the Fireworks","Here is volume 2 of the 5 Minute Feature Film series, this time on Michael Oblowitz's adaptation of Jim Thompson's This World, Then the Fireworks. The 5 Minute Feature Film series is where I take a full length movie and cut it down to 5 minutes in length, re-score it, but tell basically the same story, while simultaneously analyzing the film. You can find part one here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYM7mmakRrs&context=C459aeb4ADvjVQa1PpcFMYs4RUQYrgcQmwA2q_KX0ht3SFhm2Sq-k=, where I made a 5 minute version of the Nicolas Cage/Nicole Kidman vehicle Trespass.

This World, Then the Fireworks, starring Billy Zane, Gina Gershon, Sheryl Lee, and Rue McClanahan, is a very post-modern look at film noir, like a David Lynch film, but with less consistency of vision (I uploaded the original EPK for the film on Youtube which hammers that point even more). I reviewed the film here: http://regrettablesincerity.com/?p=8458 , and by reading that piece, you'll understand my editing choices. What's most interesting is that because of Oblowitz's style, and how it would eventually completely reveal itself on the two Steven Seagal DTV movies he made (Out for a Kill and The Foreigner), the opening montage of This World, Then the Fireworks which sets up the tone of the film and the entire story, is practically incoherent. It's cut so quickly and in such a flashy manner that there's very little way to take in the important information, so, despite cutting a 100 minute film down to 5 minutes, I actually had to slow down the opening montage to make sure you could understand what was going on. The rest of the movie is less rushed, though it still has a twitchy nature to it, and my editing was aided by the broad performances and theatrical gestures by Zane, Gershon, and especially Lee.

The music you'll hear in this Five Minute Feature is from Tchaikovsky's Symphony Pathetique and Django Reinhardt's Bouncin' Around.",9496,25,17,PT4M42S,0
1296,7j8Ba9rWhUg,Metropolis (restoration trailer),"http://www.kino.com/metropolis/
Metropolis is a 1927 silent science fiction film directed by Fritz Lang and written by Lang and Thea von Harbou. Lang and von Harbou, who were married, wrote the screenplay in 1924, and the story was novelized by von Harbou in 1926. It is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and examines a common science fiction theme of the day: the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism. The film stars Alfred Abel as the leader of the city, Gustav Fröhlich as his son, who tries to mediate between the elite caste and the workers, Brigitte Helm as both the pure-at-heart worker Maria and the debased robot version of her, and Rudolf Klein-Rogge as the mad scientist who created the robot.

Metropolis was produced in Germany in the Babelsberg Studios by Universum Film A.G. (UFA) and released in 1927 during a stable period of the Weimar Republic. The most expensive film of its time, it cost approximately 7 million Reichsmark to make. The film was cut substantially after its German premiere, and there have been several efforts to restore it. Also, the American copyright lapsed in 1953, which eventually led to a proliferation of versions being released on video.

Did you know that ""Herbie Goes Bananas"" was in fact going to be a TV movie pilot for a potential new TV series? This explains the ""new"" faces and a slight lack of quality. Herbie did in fact get a short lived TV series collectively called ""Herbie The Matchmaker"" in the early 1980s. This TV series did actually get Dean Jones back to reprise his role of Jim Douglas.

This film is considered the last true (just) Herbie feature film ever made.

Winnie (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker) e Mary (Kathy Najimy) são três bruxas do século XVII, que chegam ao século XX após seus espíritos serem evocados no Dia das Bruxas. Banidas há 300 anos devido à prática de feitiçaria, elas estão dispostas a tudo para garantir sua juventude e imortalidade. Porém precisarão enfrentar três crianças e um gato falante, que podem atrapalhar seus planos.

Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy  romp around like coked-up versions of The Three Stooges in the frantic Disney romp Hocus Pocus. The film begins in 1693 where three witches -- Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy) -- are preparing a potion that will grant them immortality and eternal youth. But before they finish mixing their cocktail, the people of Salem capture them and execute them for practicing witchcraft. Before their deaths, they vow to return to Salem 300 years hence on Halloween to exact their revenge. Three hundred years later, a skeptical, newly transplanted Californian, Max (Omri Katz), explores the ruins of the legendary witches' house and dares the witches to manifest themselves. Disregarding the warnings of his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and girlfriend Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max lights the Candle of Black Flame. With that, the witches reappear to wreak havoc on the town. The kids take off with the witches' spellbook and a musty tome of hexes and recipes. The sorceresses, who will die by the morning light if they don't recite the incantation for immortality, have to get the books by whatever means they can. So, Winifred, Sarah, and Mary hop on their broomsticks for a chase through Halloween night. ~ Paul Brenner, All Movie Guide",673827,2106,275,PT31S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Popeye (Robin Williams) eats a can of spinach transforming himself into ""Popeye the Sailor Man,"" and saving the day for all.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Based on the long-running comic strip created by E.C. Segar (and less on the animated cartoons created by Max Fleischer, which were decidedly different in tone and approach), Popeye follows the sailor man with the mighty arms (played by Robin Williams in his first major film role) as he arrives in the seaside community of Sweethaven in search of his long-lost father. Popeye meets and quickly falls for the slender Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall, in the role she was born to play), but Olive's hand has already been promised to the hulking Bluto (Paul Smith), of whom Olive can say little except, well, he's large. Eventually, Popeye and Olive are brought together by Swee' Pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt), an adorable foundling, and Popeye finally meets his dad, Poopdeck Pappy (Ray Walston). Director Robert Altman in no way tempered his trademark style for this big-budget family opus, crowding the screen with a variety of characters and allowing his cast to overlap as much dialogue as they want.

The result is one of the most propulsive action-comedies ever made with one head-spinning set piece after another. Its lighthearted approach aside, the film is faithful enough to its grisly pulp fiction roots that certain scenes (like a bloodthirsty high priest burrowing into an unlucky native’s chest to pluck out his heart) heralded the new PG-13 rating from the MPAA.

This time it’s the rabies-infected St. Bernard of Lewis Teague’s Cujo. The film’s frantically suspenseful climax helped make it a modest success in 1983 (the fourth-highest grossing horror film of the year). Teague’s in-your-face action scenes were abetted by editor Neil Travis (Terminator 3) and cinematographer Jan De Bont (eleven years before his directorial debut with Speed).

1368,Qs6z1D4gVp4,Children Of The Corn (1984) - Official Trailer,"Based on Stephen King's book. A boy preacher named Isaac goes to a town in Nebraska called Gatlin and gets all the children to murder every adult in town. A young couple have a murder to report and they go to the nearest town (Gatlin) to seek help but the town seems deserted. They are soon trapped in Gatlin with little chance of getting out alive.

Some Trivia
----------------
Though real corn was used for most of filming, polyurethane corn had to be used for the more difficult action sequences.

The tagline ""And a child shall lead them"" comes from Isaiah 11:6 in the Old Testament, which reads, ""And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.""

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Inside the vampire club, Quinn (Donal Logue) starts a fight and demands that Blade (Wesley Snipes) be hurt badly.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
British director Stephen Norrington helmed this David S. Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blade's mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires. In the 1990s (in Marvel's Nightstalkers), Blade teamed with Drake and King in an agency created to fight a variety of supernatural beings. The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blade's mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire.

The BFI National Archive proudly presents the restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Lodger' (1926), featuring a new score by Nitin Sawhney commissioned by Network Releasing in partnership with the BFI and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. This restoration is part of The Genius of Hitchcock, a major celebration of Britain's most influential and iconic filmmaker. From June to October 2012 the BFI celebrates Hitchcock's life and work with a complete retrospective of his feature films; gala events, including screenings of restorations with live music, educational projects and online initiatives. For full details see http://www.bfi.org.uk/hitchcock.

London is terrorised by a Jack the Ripper-style murderer in Hitchcock's first suspense thriller, acclaimed as 'the finest British production ever made' by the Bioscope journal on its release. Hitchcock cannily cast matinee idol Ivor Novello in the title role and challenged his audience to think the worst of him.

'The Lodger' is a restoration by the BFI National Archive in association with ITV Studios Global Entertainment, Network Releasing and Park Circus Films. Principal funding provided by The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, The Film Foundation, and Simon W Hessel.

All titles on the BFI Films channel are preserved in the vast collections of the BFI National Archive. To find out more about the Archive visit http://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections",23878,138,8,PT1M34S,0

When his boss sends him to the American south to acquire a rare painting from Loomis Gage (Harry Dean Stanton), he must contend not only with the eccentric Gage but his entire wacko family. In this scene, Gage's daughter Cora (Glenne Headly) gives Henderson a piece of her mind - and he learns that looks are deceiving.

Stars and Bars was NOT warmly received upon its release, and it's a shame, since it appears to have scared Daniel off from trying his hand at comedy again.

Life has just handed Beth Macauley the short straw. Her husband and suburban home are gone. She still has her two boys -- and a new destination. She's moving to the big city of Baltimore -- and into the biggest adventure of her life. Two-time Academy Award winner* Jessica Lange plays Beth in this warm-hearted, funny fable from Risky Business director Paul Brickman about staying together when all else is falling apart. Screen-debuting Chris O'Donnell (two years before his star making Scent of a Woman role) and Charlie Korsmo are the sons who unwittingly push Beth into one pitfall of single parenthood after another. Newcomers to Beth's world include an avant-garde composer (Arliss Howard), a flakier-than-cereal neighbor (Joan Cusack) and a boss (Kathy Bates) skilled in management by terror.

Based on Kate Grenville's novel and inspired by a true story, Lilian's Story is a triumph of heart and spirit from the director of Struck By Lightning. For 40 years Lilian Singer has been locked up in a mental hospital by her father. Left to her own devices she has lived in a world of torment and despair completely shut off from the outside world. When Lilian's release is eventually secured by her eccentric Aunt Kitty and her brother John, she faces the great unknown and embraces it with passion and courage. Searching the streets of Sydney for the essence of love and affection she never received herself, Lilian's journey becomes one of self-realisation and underlying contentment. Explored through a series of moving flashbacks her story unfolds with a colourful rainbow of characters that rest between the dark clouds of her past. With outstanding dual performances from Toni Collette (in an AFI award winning performance) and Ruth Cracknell as Lilian, and supported by Barry Otto (Bliss) and John Flaus (Newsfront) Lilian's Story is both inspirational and rewarding.",10940,28,4,PT3M5S,0

From celebrated filmmaker Shekhar Kapur (Elizabeth) comes one of the most controversial films ever produced in India, the gripping story of Phoolan Devi, a modern day Hindi Robin Hood. 
Championed by the poor and despised by the rich Phoolan Devi (Seema Biswas) was the infamous 'Goddess of Flowers'. Leader of a violent gang of bandits, responsible for killings, kidnappings and numerous robberies, her exploits became legendary.
Maintaining a tough and gritty appearance in a male-dominated world, Devi became the avenging angel of the dispossessed. Lauded by many, she was a ruthless female hero in a society where crimes against women run rife. 
A powerful, unflinching portrait of one woman's struggle for power and recognition in a dangerous and unforgiving world.",43362,91,3,PT1M43S,0

1484,M94yyfWy-KI,Edward Scissorhands (1990) - Trailer (HD/1080p),"Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American Romance, Horror, Gothic and fairy tale hybrid film directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. The film shows the story of an artificial man named Edward, an unfinished creation, who has scissors for hands. Edward is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim. Supporting roles are portrayed by Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin.
Burton conceived the idea for Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Caroline Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox, after Warner Bros. passed on the project. Edward Scissorhands was then fast tracked after Burton's success with Batman. Before Depp's casting, the leading role of Edward had been connected to Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Robert Downey, Jr., and William Hurt, while the role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and was ultimately his final performance on film.
The majority of filming took place in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, which generated over $6 million for the local economy. Edward's scissor hands were created and designed by Stan Winston. The film is also the fourth feature collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman. Edward Scissorhands was released with positive feedback from critics, and was a financial success. The film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Saturn Awards, as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work.

Until a few years ago my young niece wouldn't believe that when I had her age (the seventies) it was allowed to smoke in the cinema and that all the seats had built in little ash trays, like the ones they had on trains. 
This clip shows Peter Sellers as Mr. Martin, accountant with a firm that produces traditional Scottish tweed, trying to get rid of a newly appointed modern American bulldozer-style manager who gets on everyone's nerves and who goes too far when she suggests the company should move into synthetic fibres. Martin, having decided the only way left to him is to murder her, prepares himself by seeing a film in which a 'perfect murder' is committed, involving the use of delibererately left behind whiskey and tobacco  - the attributes which he then sets out to buy, not without difficulty as he himself doesn't  drink nor smoke...

SLAM, starring Saul Williams, Sonja Sohn, and Bonz Malone, is a powerful work of cinema verite that portrays the story of a young black performance poet, Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams), who is arrested and imprisoned for a petty marijuana charge in a Washington, D.C. jail. Although the confining prison walls do little to shield him from danger, it is within those walls that Raymond establishes his identity, strength and voice, and meets a prison gang leader (Bonz Malone) and a prison writing teacher, Lauren Bell (Sonja Sohn). Bell inspires Raymond to use the power of creative expression to free himself from the struggles and demise of the black male, as another victim of the judicial system.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
He's good at defending himself. He's good at disguising himself. He's good at getting himself into trouble...They call him Fletch (Chevy Chase).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Chevy Chase added a classic comic hero to the film landscape with Fletch, one of his few truly popular star vehicles in a famously misguided post-Saturday Night Live career. Chase plays Irwin M. Fletcher, known to everyone as Fletch, a Los Angeles Lakers-loving investigative reporter with a gleeful disdain for deadlines and a knack for pushing the buttons of his frustrated editor (Richard Libertini). He's also known for donning numerous disguises and assuming zany false identities to help gain information. While pursuing an ongoing story about a powerful drug dealer who operates from Venice Beach, he comes across an intriguing offshoot in which he becomes intimately involved. Aviation executive Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) has an unusual proposition for Fletch: If Fletch agrees to an elaborate plan to kill him, for reasons Stanwyk refuses to divulge beyond explaining that he has bone cancer, Fletch will walk away with a healthy sum of money and a plane ticket to Brazil. Curious yet suspicious by profession, Fletch begins investigating Stanwyk's true motives, which leads him through numerous misadventures. Among them are a visit to a stuffy country club; a high-speed car chase with an unwitting passenger; repeat encounters with Stanwyk's wife (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), although she may not be his only one; and a trip to Provo -- that's Utah, not Spain. Inspired by a novel of the same name by Gregory McDonald, Fletch went from thriller to comedy as it was adapted into a vehicle for Chase.

Trailer from ""Hamam - The Turkish Bath"", by Ferzan Ozpetek, with Alessandro Gassman, Francesca d'Aloja, Carlo Cecchi, Halil Ergün, Serif Sezer, Mehmet Günsür.

 

Francesco and Marta are husband and wife running a small design company in Rome. When Francescos long forgotten Aunt Anita dies in Istanbul, he travels there to look after the sale of the hamam (one of a few traditional Turkish baths left) he inherited. There he meets the family running the hamam, gets attracted to a member of it and the whole Turkish atmosphere and decides not to sell the hamam..

Francesco è un architetto italiano che alla morte della zia Anita eredita un hamam (o hammam, un ""bagno turco"") ad Istanbul in Turchia. Lascia l'Italia con l'intenzione di vendere l'immobile il prima possibile e tornare subito al suo lavoro, uno studio di architettura che condivide con la moglie - con cui ha un rapporto conflittuale - e con un altro socio. A Istanbul viene accolto dalla famiglia di Osman, che assieme alla defunta zia gestiva l'hamam, ormai chiuso da molti anni. Tutti i componenti della famiglia erano molto affezionati ad Anita, e si dimostrano amorevoli con Francesco che ne rimane piacevolmente colpito; affascinato dalla stessa Istanbul e innamoratosi di Mehmet, uno dei figli di Osman, Francesco non ritorna in Italia ma decide invece di fermarsi a Istanbul per un certo periodo e rimettere a nuovo il locale. Col prolungarsi dell'assenza di Francesco da Milano, la moglie va a cercarlo e scopre la verità; il confronto tra i due viene improvvisamente interrotto da un tragico evento, che cambia per sempre la vita della donna.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Ray (Michael Caine) uses the only thing that matters to LV -- her deceased father -- to get her to agree to playing a show.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Based on Jim Cartright's play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, this screen adaptation directed by Mark Herman is an underdog film about an underdog girl named Little Voice (or LV for short). LV (Jane Horrocks from Mike Leigh's Life is Sweet who does all her own singing) is a shy, mousy woman living with her mom Mari (Secrets and Lies' Brenda Blethyn). Little Voice doesn't leave her house. Instead she sings along to her record collection of Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, and Marilyn Monroe. Her mother Mari, however, is an outspoken woman who is convinced her sex appeal (which is little) will land her a man, especially when she's drunk. One night while bar-hopping, Mari meets the suave yet sleazy talent agent Ray Say (Michael Caine), whom she takes home for a nightcap. There Ray hears the beautiful Little Voice singing a perfect rendition of Judy Garland's ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" from The Wizard of Oz. He's stunned by its beauty and thinks he can make her a star. From there the story heads in complicated, romantic, and sweet-hearted directions that should not be given away. Also starring in this small independent film is Ewan McGregor.

1565,LmhsWy7O54E,"Alan Spencer on RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD, PART 2","Any subtleties or ambiguous notions found in 1982’s First Blood are blown up real good in this 1985 sequel. Co-written by Stallone and James Cameron, the second film picks up right where the first left off as Rambo is released from prison in order to rescue a squadron of POWs in Vietnam. Directed by George Cosmatos, the explosion-happy picture benefits from stellar tech credits with TFH Guru Mark Goldblatt in the editing bay, an evocative score by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from the brilliant Jack Cardiff.

1566,iGgug8_Tn1M,Alan Spencer on FIRST BLOOD,"As battle-scarred John Rambo, star and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone uses the post war traumas of real-life war veterans as fuel for a jingoistic revenge fantasy in the mode of Death Wish and Walking Tall. Efficiently directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, North Dallas Forty), 1982’s First Blood is the quintessential Reagan era action film; the beleaguered Rambo takes up arms against a corrupt Washington state police department and essentially goes to war with his own government. Andrew Lazlo’s (Southern Comfort, Innerspace) beautiful cinematography (utilizing the lush landscapes of British Columbia) recalls Vilmos Zsigmond’s work on The Deer Hunter and Jerry Goldsmith’s thoughtful score conveys an appropriately manly but melancholy mood.

Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and wife, Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), decide to take it easy on Christmas and host a big family get-together. Typical of the Griswold's, however, is the disaster that results.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Chevy Chase, star of National Lampoon's Vacation and its sequel, is back as the paterfamilias of the Griswold family (including Beverly D'Angelo as his missus) to skewer the Yuletide season. Chevy mugs, trips, falls, mashes his fingers and stubs his toes as he prepares to invite numerous dysfunctional relatives to his household to celebrate Christmas. Amidst the more outrageous sight gags (including the electrocution of a cat as the Christmas tree is lit) the film betrays a sentimental streak, with old wounds healing and long-estranged relatives reuniting in the Griswold living room. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was still capable of attracting an audience five years after its release -- it was one of the top-rated seasonal TV specials of 1994, outrating even the first network telecast of It's a Wonderful Life.

1583,znESQTt3L80,YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998) - Official Movie Trailer,"You've Got Mail (1998) / Вам Письмо (Трейлер)
Director: Nora Ephron
Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Greg Kinnear.

Nominated for Golden Globe.

You've Got Mail is a 1998 American romantic comedy film released by Warner Bros. It is based on a manuscript of the same title written by the film's director, Nora Ephron, in which two letter-writing lovers are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. The film is a remake of the Ernst Lubitsch film The Shop Around the Corner. (There was also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime starring Judy Garland.) You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly — a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film.

The name of the film is an example of product placement, based on the trademark greeting that AOL users hear when they receive new e-mail. About one year later, AOL and Time Warner (the entertainment conglomerate that owns Warner Bros. studios, which released this film) announced a corporate merger.

The film received significant media coverage leading up to its release in anticipation of the romantic coupling of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who had appeared together previously in Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993).

Plot:
Two business rivals hate each other at the office but fall in love over the internet.

One day, Alan Darcy, a highly motivated man with the same kind of youth experience, starts trying to get the young people off the street and into doing something they can believe in: Boxing. Soon he opens a training facility which is accepted gratefully by them and the gangs start to grow together into friends. Darcy manages to organize a public fight for them to prove what they have learned. A training camp with hiking tours into the mountains of Wales forge the group into a tight-knit club society.

""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"".

Synopsis:

In this third sequel to slasher classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, four Texas teens are abducted by a family of psychos on their way home from the senior prom. Bloodshed, torture, and intrigue ensue. Barry (Tyler Cone) and Sean (John Harrison) meet their fates quickly, but semi-bimbo Heather (Lisa Newmyer) lasts long enough to be tortured and burned before having her head cracked open like a walnut by a mechanical leg. Meanwhile, sweet, befuddled Jenny (Renee Zellweger) actively resists her captors by stealing cars, breaking through windows, and jumping off roofs. Although Leatherface (Robert Jacks), the human skin-wearing transvestite based on real-life serial killer Ed Gein, is back on board, the cannibal cast this time out also includes several new characters, from bionic villain Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) to trashy realtor Darla (Tonie Perensky) and literature-quoting flunky W.E. (Joe Stevens). The plot also adds an X-Files-esque conspiracy to the basic Chainsaw concept in the form of deformed businessman Rothman (James Gale), who descends on the family of killers to critique their torture techniques. Written and directed by original Massacre scribe Kim Henkel, the film appeared at 1995 festivals in a 104-minute cut under the title The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre; after actors Zellweger and McConaughey became Hollywood stars, the film was re-titled, re-cut, and given a limited theatrical release in August of 1997. The nine minutes of deleted footage included scenes of Jenny's troubled home life. Both versions included brief cameos from Marilyn Burns, Paul Partain, and John Dugan -- all of whom appeared in Tobe Hooper's original film. Prodigious litigation preceded the film's re-release, although both the McConaughey and Zellweger camps denied attempting to block its release. The film's soundtrack includes a who's who of local Texas bands.

A look at Paul Taylor (1930- ) and his dance company over several months in 1997. Preparation of Taylor's piece, ""Piazzolla Caldera,"" from conception and rehearsals to opening night at City Center, frames the film. The troupe's trip to India falls in the middle. Included are black and white footage of rehearsals, and, in color, interviews with Taylor, his dancers, dance critics and scholars, and those who manage the business side. There is also footage of a younger Taylor dancing and film of the troupe performing a dozen Taylor pieces.

Rare, candid interviews with the reclusive Bowles--at home in Tangier, as well as in New York during an extraordinary final reunion with Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs--are intercut with conflicting views of his supporters and detractors.

Dick Foran plays the high-spirited hero, Wallace Ford provides the comedy relief and former cowboy star Tom Tyler, with his shark-like black eyes, makes for a particularly spooky mummy.

The film has always been regarded as a black and white classic when it was nothing of the sort. When audiences originally saw the film in theatres the daylight scenes were in amber, the night in pale blue, the eerie scenes in green and the fiery climax in red. Universal also thought it was necessary to hype the film up a bit. As if the film wasnt scary enough on its own the studio found it in their best interest to park an ambulance out in front of many theatres and to keep two nurses on hand in the lobby to raise the chill factor. They even went as far as to place an actress in the audience during every showing who would, at the scariest moment in the film, scream, jump out of her seat, and run up the aisle and out of the theatre. Too bad we dont see theatrics like that anymore.",314803,490,82,PT1M46S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
An unlikely relationship blossoms between the most famous actress in the world (Julia Roberts) and a charming bookkeeper (Hugh Grant) living in Notting Hill.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Can a beautiful and internationally famous American actress find happiness with a frumpy British bookstore clerk? She can -- at least for a while, it seems -- in Notting Hill. William Thacker (played by Hugh Grant) is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend, Spike (Rhys Ifans). One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss -- just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family (not to mention the world at large) wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star. Notting Hill reunites Hugh Grant with producer Duncan Kenworthy and screenwriter Richard Curtis, who previously worked together on the international hit Four Weddings And A Funeral.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Otello (Plácido Domingo) rejoices in victory with his men, and then finishes the celebration with a passionate kiss from Desdemona (Katia Ricciarelli).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Having previously staged Verdi's 1887 opera Otello at the Met and La Scala, filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli committed his production to film in 1986. Starring as the fatally jealous Moor of Venice is Placido Domingo, who had also headlined Zeffirelli's 1976 La Scala staging (production on the film was briefly interrupted while Domingo participated in the rescue operations following the Mexico City earthquake). While Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona and Justino Diaz as Iago perform their own singing, Zeffirelli's Cassio--played by real-life European prince Urbano Barberini--is dubbed by Ezio de Cesare. The director made several cuts in the original libretto and score in order to accommodate the film's two-hour time limit, but these excisions are done with taste and discretion. Because of the excessive violence in the third act--two murders, a suicide, a superficial throat-slashing--Otello was released with a PG rating.

1802,lAoT2ktM2H0,The Mission - Gabriel's Oboe (Full HD),"This is a clip of Gabriel's Oboe from a 1986 movie, The Mission.

About Gabriel Obe (source: Wikipedia)
--------------------------------------------------------
""Gabriel's Oboe"" is the main theme for the 1986 film The Mission directed by Roland Joffé. The theme was written by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, and has since been arranged and performed several times by artists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Holly Gornik, and Brynjar Hoff, among others. The theme has been called ""unforgettable"" and a ""celebrated oboe melody"". Vocalist Sarah Brightman begged Morricone to allow her to put lyrics to the theme to create her own song, ""Nella Fantasia"". In 2010, Morricone encouraged soprano Hayley Westenra to write English lyrics for ""Gabriel's Oboe"" in her album Paradiso.
The soundtrack for the film was very well received amongst critics, being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and earning Morricone the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.
In the film, the theme is most prominently used when the protagonist, the Jesuit Father Gabriel, walks up to a waterfall and starts playing his oboe, aiming to befriend the natives with his music so he can carry his missionary work in the New World. The Guaraní tribesmen, who have been stalking him from a distance, approach Gabriel for the first time, puzzled by the sounds of the unknown instrument. The chief of the tribe, however, is displeased by this, and breaks Gabriel's oboe. This marks the beginning of the relationship between Father Gabriel and the Guaraní natives.
Several orchestras have performed ""Gabriel's Oboe"", often under the direction of Morricone himself. The most famous renditions of the piece, other than in the movie, are probably those found in the Morricone Conducts Morricone series of concerts during the mid-2000s.
Keith and Kristyn Getty incorporated the song and blended it with their own verses with lyrics in their 2012 release ""Hymns for the Christian Life"" on track 12 ""Holy Spirit (with Gabriel's Oboe).""

About The Mission, 1986 film (source: Wikipedia)

1826,54nxTqUBxJ4,Joe Dante on TOMB OF LIGEIA,"Roger Corman bids farewell to his Edgar Allan Poe series with a beautifully mounted departure from the heavy stylization of previous entries, played more like a gothic romance. Vincent Price would go on to top line an eccentric collection of further Poe ""adaptations"", some of them in name only.  Elizabeth Shepherd is a strong proto-Jane Austin heroine, and also plays Price's dead wife who haunts him from the grave in the form of a black cat. It's an intelligent and satisfying climax to the Corman/Poe saga.

England was such a proper place - until the day the Python arrived. Monty Python, that is, a Flying Circus that slithered up the funnybone of an entire nation and gave it fits of laughter.


Here's Monty Python's first feature film - a hilarious collection of their very best twits, skits and bits from their popular TV series. There's ""Hell's Grannies"" and ""The Cannibal Baby Strollers,"" ""The Dead Parrot"" routine (he's just resting!) and valuable tips on how to defend yourself against an attacker armed with a piece of fruit. And who will ever forget ""The Lumberjack Song"" (""I cut down trees, I wear high heels, suspenders and a bra..."")?

And, of course, plenty of zany Monty Python animation. Absolutely the silliest stuff since the day Ernest Scribbler wrote the world's funniest joke and died (croak!) laughing.

MPAA Rated PG for suggestive humor, nude images, some mild language and violence.

However, as the severity of the wounds increases, Kiernan realises Frankie has become the vessel for an extraordinary and provocative message that threatens the very foundations of the Catholic Church, and now the stigmata is not the only thing threatening her life.

Cary Grant followed up his successful role in GUNGA DIN with another signature performance, his edgiest to date, in one of the finest entries in the magical movie year of 1939. It was the second of five films he would make with director Howard Hawks. Famous as the supposed origin of the oft-quoted Cary Grant impersonation line ""Judy, Judy, Judy"", one of the best-known lines never actually spoken in a movie.

movie you've been waiting for. The Who's brilliant rock opera is sublimely
matched by director Ken Russell's penchant for cinematic excess during the
peak of his filmmaking audacity. Tommy revolves around the 'deaf, dumb, and
blind kid' (Roger Daltrey) who survives the childhood trauma that stole his
senses to become a Pinball Wizard in Pete Townshend's grandiose attack on
the hypocrisy of organised religion. Tommy's odyssey is rendered through
wall-to-wall music, from the bloodstream shock of Tina Turner to Elton John's
towering rendition of 'Pinball Wizard' and Daltrey's epiphanous rendition of
'I'm Free'. Other star performers include Eric Clapton and the Who's drummer
Keith Moon in this classic of creative rock cinema.

This documentary captures the unprecedented effort displayed by an organization called Warrior's Weekend of Victoria, Texas. The determination of hundreds, if not thousands of patriots from the cities of Houston and Victoria as well as other surrounding towns, is manifest in this documentary and displays their dedication and loyalty to our country and appreciation to those who serve in the military.
We have captured the blood, sweat and tears that have been shed as over 350 wounded soldiers are brought to Victoria and then on to Port O'Connor, Texas from all over the United States.
Warrior's Weekend has created a most dynamic, ""rock star"" environment as these true American heroes get a good dose of Texas hospitality. From the moment their planes land in Houston, or they board a chartered bus at Brooke Army Medical Center or Fort Hood, these men and women are overwhelmed by just how many people honor their service and sacrifice. They are greeted at Faith Family Church by local schools and several hundred more patriots. After refreshments and a quick welcome ceremony, the soldiers are led to the Field of Honor which has over 2,500 large American flags. Each flag represents an individual soldier that local businesses and individuals have purchased.  The flags also bear the names of soldiers that are currently serving or commemorate those who have served our country.  As the service men and women arrive at Port O'Connor, Texas, they are just as captivated at the sight of the highway lined with people and hundreds of American flags being flown to welcome them. Then on to the fishing docks!  There they find 226 fishing vessels set to idle as the boat captains anxiously await the arrival of their American hero. The fishermen help the soldiers board the craft and then off they go to retrieve their bounty. 
In conjunction with a weekend to be remembered by all, I believe this documentary will touch the hearts and lives of all who see it and restore the importance of honoring those who serve this wonderful country we call America.",5030,23,4,PT4M42S,0

There’s a touch of melancholy about the duplicitous romance between Barbara Stanwyck’s luscious but two-faced card shark and Henry Fonda’s hopelessly naive beer magnate but it’s mitigated by another stellar Sturges supporting cast including the magnificent William Demarest who has the (literal) last word: “Positively the same dame!”

Scheider’s innate good humor alleviates his character’s darker inclinations adding up to a memorable portrait of a charismatic megalomaniac.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) is not impressed with the RoboCop 2 prototypes.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The serialized story structure and barbed social commentary from comic book creator and co-writer Frank Miller earned critical respect in this satirical science fiction sequel directed by Irvin Kershner. Peter Weller returns as RoboCop, a futuristic cyborg fashioned from cutting-edge technology and the biological remains of slain Detroit police officer, Alex Murphy. Still patrolling the city streets, RoboCop is scheduled by his creator, Omni Consumer Products, to be replaced by a new ""superior"" model, RoboCop 2, that according to designer Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer), will contain the human remains not of a cop but a criminal. In the meantime, an instantly addictive drug called Nuke is sweeping through Detroit thanks to a kingpin named Cain (Tom Noonan). Taking Cain to task, RoboCop is captured and dismantled. When he's put back together, the cyborg is reprogrammed with a series of socially conscious commands (in a sly mocking of the then relatively new concept of ""political correctness"") that render him impotent as a law enforcer. Taking charge by rewiring himself with an electrical overload, RoboCop arrests Cain, who is injured in the process. Faxx secretly takes Cain's brain and inserts it into RoboCop 2, turning the robot immediately into a law-breaking murder machine and leading to a violent showdown between two generations of robotic crime-fighters.

1990,wLJ8Z3PDEGU,Re-Animator (1985) Trailer,"Adapted from H.P. Lovecraft’s sepulchral 1922 pulp horror story, arguably the first such tale to ever consider scientifically affected corpses as zombies, Re-Animator is Stuart Gordon’s cult classic trip into the realm of the living dead.

Conducting clandestine experiments within the morgue at Miskatonic University, scientist Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs, From Beyond) reveals to fellow graduate student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) his groundbreaking work concerning the re-animation of fresh corpses. West’s secret reagent is a powerful injection with the capacity to give life where there is none – destined to capture the imagination of the entire scientific community. However, between life and death is a thin thread of understanding and when obsession gets the better of West, there is no stopping his wicked ways – dead or alive!

Presented complete and uncut in gore-glistening HD with all-new special features, Re-Animator is a true horror-fest of mortal manipulation in the most demented sense.

Intercepted Japanese messages warn of it - but never reach F.D.R.'s desk. Radar warnings are disregarded. Even the entrapment of a Japanese submarine in Pearl Harbor before the attack goes unreported. Ultimately the Day of Infamy arrives - in the most spectacular, gut-wrenching cavalcade of action-packed footage ever. You'll see moments of unsurpassed spectacle and heroism: U.S. fighters trying to take off and being hit as they taxi; men blasted from the decks of torpedoed ships while trying to rescue buddies; savage aerial dogfights pitting lone American fliers against squadrons of Imperial war planes.

2025,MLlGZQkU3ak,The Effect of Gamma Rays 1972,"Paul Zindel hatvanas évek közepén kelt színjátékának  a maga idejében a Broadwayn volt nagy sikere. Az 1972-es moziváltozat  a hetvennégyes Mikulás meghozta a pesti mozikba is.
A Gamma-sugarak emlékezetesen ""családi film"", a szó minden lehetséges értelmében, melyek közül a kevésbé érdekes, de aligha elhagyható, hogy a rendezõ (Paul Newman) a mû döntõ szerepeit feleségére és lányára bízta. Ám családi film abban a tekintetben is, hogy a családról, adott esetben egy megcsonkult családról szól. A Joanne Woodward játszta megözvegyült anya, Beatrice két lánygyermekével és a körülötte lévõ világgal küzd, jobbára  álmaiba menekülve. 
Az egyik lánya epilepsziás, a másik magával van elfoglalva - ami egyben a mû kulcsa is, hisz az emberek viselkedése is megjelenik éppenséggel a virágkép(let)ekben. Voltaképpen nem is az érdekes, hogy mi lesz Beatrice családjával, hanem az, hogyan látja õket a rendezõ.
Egy alapvetõen szomorú és gyakorlatilag kilátástalan alapszituáció jelenik meg a vásznon, tagadhatatlanul vidám, illetve vidámító körülmények között, az elbeszélés és az elõadás határozott törekvései szerint. És ráadásnak az sem egy utolsó mulatság, ha Newman második rendezését összehasonlítjuk Robert Redford elsõ rendezésével, az Átlagemberekkel.
Az elbeszélés és az előadás határozott törekvései szerint megoldást keres, kérdéseket tesz fel és válaszol meg a szeretet (mint gamma-sugár) virágot (mint reményt) fakasztó potenciájáról.

„Ha majd a sugárzást jobban megértjük, eljön egy nap, amikor az atomrobbanásból keletkező erő megváltoztatja egész eddig ismert világunkat. És ezek nagyszerű változások lesznek; álmainkat meghaladó, csodálatos dolgok, és én azt hiszem, egész lelkemmel hiszem, eljön a nap, amikor a hálás emberiség köszönetet mond Istennek a csodálatos áldást hozó atomenergiáért.""

One day Helen and her boyfriend Michael (Ian Hendry) go off on holiday together and Carol is left alone in the empty apartment. Extremely paranoid, Carol refuses to let anyone in and never leaves the building herself, in effect breaking off all contact with the outside world. In this claustrophobic environment, she begins to lose her grip on reality, suffering from hallucinations of being attacked by a phantom rapist and hands reaching out from the walls to grab her.

Irma la Douce Trailer - Directed by Billy Wilder and starring Jack Lemmon, Jack Lemmon, Lou Jacobi, Bruce Yarnell, Herschel Bernardi. Irma la Douce is a 1963 comedy starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, directed by Billy Wilder. Though the film is not a musical, it won AndrÉ Previn an Academy Award for Best Score Adaptation or Treatment. There is also a scene in the film, in which Shirley MacLaine exclaims ""Dis-donc!"" whilst dancing on a table, which appears to be a deliberate tribute to the musical from which the film is derived. The film was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Shirley MacLaine) and Best Cinematography, Color.

Mansfield Park (1999) Official Trailer # 1- Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller Movie HD

At 10, Fanny Price, a poor relation, goes to live at Mansfield Park, the estate of her aunt's husband, Sir Thomas. Clever, studious, and a writer with an ironic imagination and fine moral compass, she becomes especially close to Edmund, Thomas's younger son. Fanny is soon possessed of beauty as well as a keen mind and comes to the attention of a neighbor, Henry Crawford. Thomas promotes this match, but to his displeasure, Fanny has a mind of her own, asking Henry to prove himself worthy. As Edmund courts Henry's sister and as light shines on the link between Thomas's fortunes and New World slavery, Fanny must assess Henry's character and assert her heart as well as her wit.

Σύνοψη
Ένα ταξίδι αναψυχής μετατρέπεται σε εφιάλτη όταν δύο φίλοι παίρνουν με ωτο-στοπ έναν ψυχοπαθή κατάδικο ο οποίος τους ανακοινώνει ότι στο τέλος του ταξιδιού θα τους σκοτώσει. Σαν να μην έφτανε αυτό, η ιδιαιτερότητα που έχει στο ένα μάτι του το οποίο μένει μόνιμα ανοικτό, δεν τους αφήνει να γνωρίζουν πότε κοιμάται και πότε είναι ξύπνιος. Το ωτο-στοπ του Τρόμου είναι το πρώτο φιλμ νουαρ  σκηνοθετημένο από γυναίκα το 1953.
Φιλμ νουάρ είναι κινηματογραφικός όρος που χρησιμοποιείται κυρίως για να ορίσει ένα συγκεκριμένο στυλ σε αστυνομικές ταινίες του Χόλιγουντ που δίνουν έμφαση στον κυνισμό των χαρακτήρων και τα συναισθηματικά - ερωτικά τους κίνητρα. Η κλασική περίοδος του φιλμ νουάρ στις ΗΠΑ εκτείνεται από τις αρχές της δεκαετίας του '40 μέχρι το τέλος της δεκαετίας του '50. Οι ταινίες αυτής της εποχής χαρακτηρίζονται από χαμηλό φωτισμό και έντονες ασπρόμαυρες αντιθέσεις, επιρροές από το γερμανικό εξπρεσιονισμό. Επίσης, πληθώρα ιστοριών και συμπεριφορών χαρακτήρων προέρχονται από το χώρο του αστυνομικού μυθιστορήματος στις ΗΠΑ κατά την περίοδο της Οικονομικής Ύφεσης.

Nicholson is fantastic, as usual, but it's one of his smaller films that was immediately overshadowed by ""Chinatown"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest"" that followed in the next two years, respectively.  At the time of the film's release, it was a huge success and Nicholson's performance was regarded highly.  Columbia then pulled the film from release, rereleasing it closer to Oscar time, but any buzz that had been generated had worn off by that time.  Still, Nicholson was nominated as was Robert Towne, the great screenwriter, and Randy Quaid for Best Supporting Actor.  Based on the novel by Darryl Ponicsan.

Achievement-oriented Marcus (Kevin Costner) is a nationally-ranked cyclist. Younger brother David (David Grant) is a drifter, content to cruise through life on a 10-speed. Time-and the painful events surrounding their father's death-have turned the siblings' differences into an open rift. So they try to bridge the gap by competing together in the Hell of the West, a grueling race through the Rocky Mountains. For the first time ever, the brothers train and race side-by-side...while each privately confronts a nagging fear: the congenital ailment that struck down their father could just suddenly strike one of them. Writer Steve Tesich, and Academy Award winner for his bike-racing opus Breaking Away, now captures the sport's excitement on an even larger scale. Against the backdrop of the Coors International Classic, the U.S.'s largest, most prestigious race, Tesich and director John Badham craft a dazzling, spirit-soaring spectacle. Says Rex Reed: ""You'll go away feeling good! American Flyers is a fine mixture of romance, humor and tears with action sequences among the most exciting ever captured on film.""

HOWARDS END - 2016 4k Restoration
Directed by James Ivory
Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
Starring Anthony Hopkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson

One of Merchant Ivory’s undisputed masterpieces, this adaptation of E.M. Forster’s classic 1910 novel is a saga of class relations and changing times in Edwardian England. Margaret Schlegel (Emma Thompson) and her sister Helen (Helena Bonham Carter) become involved with two couples: a wealthy, conservative industrialist (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife (Vanessa Redgrave), and a working-class man (Samuel West) and his mistress (Niccola Duffet). The interwoven fates and misfortunes of these three families and the diverging trajectories of the two sisters’ lives are connected to the ownership of Howards End, a beloved country home. A compelling, brilliantly acted study of one woman’s struggle to maintain her ideals and integrity in the face of Edwardian society’s moribund conformist values.

It is the third movie adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1937 novel of the same name. The first adaptation was made in 1939, and a made-for-TV movie version was produced in 1981. It was released on October 2, 1992 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures.

George Milton (Gary Sinise) is in a train boxcar, reminiscing upon the events that have just happened. He thinks back to when he and his companion Lennie Small (John Malkovich), who has learning difficulties and the mentality of a small child, are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed. They were run out of town after Lennie was accused of attempted rape when he touched and held onto a young woman's pretty dress (prompted by his love of stroking soft things). After running from Weed, George and Lennie are trying to attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream, which he never tires of hearing George describe, is merely to have soft rabbits on the farm, which he can pet. The two go to work at a ranch named Tyler Ranch.

At the ranch, the dream appears to move closer to reality. Candy (Ray Walston), the aged, one-handed ranch-hand, offers to pitch in with Lennie and George so they can buy the farm. The dream disappears when Lennie accidentally kills the young and attractive wife (Sherilyn Fenn) of Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the ranch owner's son, while trying to stroke her hair. A lynch mob led by Curley gathers. Realizing he is doomed to a life of loneliness and despair like the rest of the migrant workers, and wanting to spare Lennie a painful death at the hands of the vengeful and violent Curley, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head before the mob can find him. The film comes to a close with the opening scene of George reminiscing in the train boxcar. The last minute of the movie depicts another memory: George and Lennie working together.",416297,826,377,PT2M23S,0

Disgusted with the inauthenticity of common society, Richard treks across Asia while avoiding all tourist settings at all costs.  In a shoddy Bangkok hotel, Richard meets a man who appears to be insane and calls himself Daffy.  Daffy tells Richard of a paradise unlike any other; a paradise in its purest form, untouched by humans exploiting nature.  When Richard awakens to find a crudely drawn map and that Daffy had killed himself, he decides to embark on a journey to find this paradise lagoon.  The Beach features a strong isolated island atmosphere and plenty of gorgeous scenery and backdrops.  The plot starts somewhat like an adventure romance but becomes increasingly more unorthodox until a climatic ending that breaks any stereotype it may have set earlier in the movie.

2181,A-R9PysOaxI,Byrd's First Antarctic Expedition 1928,"Byrd Antarctic Expedition 1928. Richard E. Byrd

""In 1928, Admiral Byrd began his first expedition to the Antarctic involving two ships, and three airplanes: Byrd's Flagship was The City of New York; a Ford Trimotor called the Floyd Bennett (named after the recently deceased pilot of Byrd's previous expeditions); a Fairchild FC-2W2, NX8006, built 1928, named ""Stars And Stripes"" (now displayed at the Virginia Aviation Museum, on loan from the National Air and Space Museum); and a Fokker Universal monoplane called the Virginia (Byrd's birth state). A base camp named ""Little America"" was constructed on the Ross Ice Shelf and scientific expeditions by snowshoe, dog-sled, snowmobile, and airplane began. Photographic expeditions and geological surveys were undertaken for the duration of that summer, and constant radio communications were maintained with the outside world. After their first winter, their expeditions were resumed, and on 28 November 1929, the famous flight to the South Pole and back was launched. Byrd, along with pilot Bernt Balchen, co-pilot/radioman Harold June, and photographer Ashley McKinley, flew the Ford Trimotor to the South Pole and back in 18 hours, 41 minutes. They had difficulty gaining enough altitude, and they had to dump empty gas tanks, as well as their emergency supplies, in order to achieve the altitude of the Polar Plateau. However, the flight was successful, and it entered Byrd into the history books. After a further summer of exploration, the expedition returned to North America on 18 June 1930. A 19 year-old American Boy Scout, Paul Allman Siple, was chosen to accompany the expedition. Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the American Geographical Society. This was also seen in the 1930 film With Byrd at the South Pole in which it covered his trip there.
Byrd, by then an internationally recognized, pioneering American polar explorer and aviator, served for a time as Honorary National President (1931--1935) of Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society in the social sciences.

A psychological revenge saga of Shakespearean proportions, and masterfully filmed in Cinemascope and Technicolor, The Man from Laramie is one of the most powerful dramas of the 1950s.

The movie documents the Apollo missions - perhaps the most definitively of any movie under two hours. Al Reinert watched all the footage shot during the missions--over 6,000,000 feet of it, and picked out the best. Instead of being a newsy, fact-filled documentary, Reinart focuses on the human aspects of the space flights. The only voices heard in the film are the voices of the astronauts and mission control. Reinart uses the astronaunts' own words from interviews and from the mission footage. The score by Brian Eno underscores the strangeness, wonder, and and beauty of the astronauts' experiences--experiences which they were privileged to have for a first time ""for all mankind.""

The Canadians are the best that the Canadian army has to offer: spit and polish, multi-skilled and all experienced soldiers. The Americans are the dregs of the US Army: misfits and troublemakers lacking any kind of discipline. Over time, Frederick forges a unified, highly competent fighting force. Initially trained for a commando operation in Norway, Frederick has to move quickly to keep the unit together after the operation is canceled.

The two people, played by Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley, feel the turtles' pain without knowing each other at first and plan a heist to send them back into the ocean, which some people think is a daft idea, and some think is worse than daft. But this story is more than a turtle heist. Much more.

Directed by John Irvin and adapted by Harold Pinter from Russell Hoban's novel; also starring Michael Gambon and featuring a cameo by Peter Capaldi.

This film was given to me by a friend of my parents and has been uploaded to the internet because it has not yet received a DVD release, it has only been released on VHS once and never again. You won't find it on any shelf, which is a damn shame because it's an intelligent and emotional film that deserves far more attention.

2282,1_I4WgBfETc,Red Dawn Trailer (1984),"Trailer for the 1984 classic Red Dawn.  Avenge Me, WOLVERINES!

It is the dawn of World War III. In mid-western America, a group of teenagers bands together to defend their town, and their country, from invading Soviet forces.

From out of the sky, Soviet, Nicaraguan, and Cuban troops begin landing on the football field of a Colorado high school. In seconds, the paratroopers have attacked the school and sent a group of teenagers fleeing into the mountains. Armed only with hunting rifles, pistols, and bows and arrows, the teens struggle to survive the bitter winter and the Soviet KGB patrols hunting for them. Eventually, trouble arises when they kill a group of Soviet soldiers on patrol in the highlands. Soon they will wage their own guerrilla warfare against the invading Soviet troops-under the banner of 'Wolverines!'

Starring Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Powers Boothe, Harry Dean Stanton. Directed by John Milius.

Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Longtime neighbors and rivals John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) chase after the same woman (Ann-Margret).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This cheerful holiday comedy, a surprise box office smash, featured a generous dollop of raunchy, crude humor and was greatly elevated by the presence of masterful performers in the lead roles. Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile.

2295,0km5zKJhxXI,Blood and Sand Trailer,"""Blood and Sand"" stars a ravishing Sharon Stone in a memorable pre-""Basic Instinct"" vamp role.
Previously filmed in 1922 featuring Rudolph Valentino and in 1940 with Tyrone Power, Vicente Blasco Ibanez's mystical bullfight novel Blood & Sand was given a third big-screen treatment in this 1989 Jose Frade Spanish production. In addition to Stone, it casts American actor Christopher Rydell as the bullfighter hero Juan Gallardo. Her role was previously essayed in 1922 by Nita Naldi and in 1940 by Rita Hayworth. The story remains the same: a dirt-poor youth rises to fame and fortune in the bull ring, forgets his roots, cheats on his wife, has a last-minute change of heart, and pays for his sins in grotesque fashion.
The story revolves around the young, talented, and naturally gifted torero Juan Gallardo. Gallardo wants to be popular in bull fighting. His love Carmen has a cousin who has left home with Gallardo for a bullfighting competition. After a bull charges the neophyte Gallardo, his friend intercepts and saves Gallardo at the cost of his own life.
A despondent Gallardo runs away and meets Lady Dona Sol (played by Stone), a beautiful, rich lady, who offers him a job to work her fields. However, Gallardo insists on becoming a superstar in bull fighting in his country, and, on the advice of a security guard, he joins the famous bull fighting trainer, Nacional. Nacional trains and prepares Gallardo for competition.

2303,zF5b11vIcZ0,Wonderful scene from Dersu Uzala (1975),"Dersu Uzala is often considered to be one of Kurosawa's finest films, and should be a must see for any dedicated movie-goer. The film holds many of Kurosawa's hallmarks as a director: Thoughts on everyday life, subtle philosophy brewing underneath, great cinematography and camerawork, long shots, and of course plenty of wind!

This scene is probably the most memorable from the film. The captain and his guide, Dersu, find themselves separated from the rest of their men and lost in the deep Siberian tundra. There, in order to survive, they have to build a shelter of straw before the night falls over the land. It is a breathtaking (literally) scene, with a lot more quality than any Spielberg or Bay-movie that tend to crowd the cinemas nowadays.

I'm sorry about the video quality, it could have been a lot better. I hope though that you'll manage to enjoy the view anyhow! It actually turns out quite good in fullscreen. Also there are no subtitles to this, so delight in the atmosphere and beauty instead. ;)",71433,345,39,PT9M57S,0

2309,wnrqC8-YCDE,LA BAMBA 30th Anniversary Dual Format Trailer,"Born to Poverty. Destined for Stardom.  He lived the American Dream.

The life of rock & roll legend Ritchie Valens bursts across the screen in the highly celebrated music-filled biopic La Bamba, starring Lou Diamond Phillips (Young Guns, Che) as the teenage sensation whose rise to fame was tragically cut short at the age of 17.

Phillips gives an electrifying performance as Valens, who has to contend with racial prejudice, a jealous brother (a stunningly intense Esai Morales, NYPD Blue, Caprica) and an overbearing mother, before his unique style of Latino-influenced rock & roll rockets him to fame, but sets him on the path for an unavoidable date with destiny. 

Featuring music from Grammy Award winning rock band Los Lobos, and also starring Elizabeth Peña (Jacob’s Ladder, Down and Out in Beverly Hills), director Luis Valdez’s La Bamba is an irresistibly toe-tapping depiction of the early days of American rock music, and the indelible influence one young man had upon it. Eureka Entertainment is proud to present the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK in a 30th Anniversary Digitally Restored Dual Format Edition.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
While the team trains, Phillip Elliot (Nick Nolte) and Seth Maxwell (Mac Davis) train there liver and lungs by drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In a society in which major league sporting events have replaced Sunday worship as the religion of choice, North Dallas Forty appears like a desecration at the altar. In this film, directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz), the National Football League is revealed to be more about the money than the game. Nick Nolte is North Dallas Bulls pass-catcher Phillip Elliott, whose cynicism and independent spirit is looked upon as troublesome by team coaches Johnson (Charles Durning) and Strothers (G.D. Spradlin) and team owner Conrad Hunter (Steve Forrest). Elliot, at the end of his career and wise to the way players are bought and sold like cattle, goes through the games pumped up on painkillers conveniently provided by the management. His teammates include savvy quarterback Maxwell (Mac Davis) and lunk-headed defensive lineman Jo Bob Priddy (Bo Svenson), who deal with the impersonality and back-biting of the game through off-field diversions. When the Bulls management benches Elliot after manipulating him to help train a fellow teammate, Elliot has to decide whether there is more to life than the game that he loves.

If given a fair chance, it is very enjoyable, and features great acting, production, and a good plot overall. Robert Shaw and Harrison Ford have co-starring leads, with Ford being fresh from the role that made him a household name--Han Solo in STAR WARS. Ford portrays American Ranger Lt. Col. Mike Barnsby, the leader of a commando unit sent to Yugoslavia to destroy a vital bridge that will allow Nazi forces to move into Partisan territory. Shaw's character is Major Mallory, who joins Barnsby's unit but has a mission of his own: seek out and elminate a double agent operating with the Yugoslavian resistance fighters. This movie is also of note because it marked Robert Shaw's final film appearance. He died of a heart attack shortly after finishing the project.

Desperate for a hit after the flop of Sweet Charity, director Bob Fosse rode herd on the cast, especially Joel Grey, who originated the role of the creepy Kit Kat Klub emcee on Broadway but almost lost his Oscar-winning part in the movie to Fosse’s initial choice… Ruth Gordon. At one point Fosse spitefully reduced all Grey’s musical numbers to snippets (the producers put it all back). The finished movie won eight Oscars including Best Director for Fosse and Best Actress for star Liza Minnelli, who never had a better role. Christopher Isherwood’s “Berlin Stories”, which introduced the character of Sally Bowles, had been filmed as a straight drama in 1955 under the title I Am a Camera.

Held Up (1999) Official Trailer #1 - Jamie Foxx Movie HD

While they're on vacation in the Southwest, Rae finds out her man Michael spent their house money on a classic car, so she dumps him, hitching a ride to Vegas for a flight home. A kid promptly steals Michael's car, leaving him at the Zip & Sip, a convenience store. Three bumbling robbers promptly stage a hold up. Two take off with the cash stranding the third, with a mysterious crate, just as the cops arrive. The robber takes the store hostage. As incompetent cops bring in a SWAT team and try a by-the-book rescue, Michael has to keep the robber calm, find out what's in the crate, aid the negotiations, and get back to Rae. The Stockholm Syndrome asserts its effect.

A less drastic tack is taken by the heroes of Bruce Kessler's drive-in situation comedy: they pretend to be gay, and have to keep up the pretense while trying to date girls on the side. The expected stereotypes abound, but all looks pretty goofy and innocuous today. Some in the LGBT community consider it progressive for its time. A bikini-clad Candice Rialson can be glimpsed in a bit part on her way to B-movie stardom.

2386,S5175bV18MM,Original Theatrical Trailer | Gypsy | Warner Archive,"Gypsy (1962) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #Gypsy

Ringing with the showbiz sass of its Jule Styne/Stephen Sondheim score, the film version of the Broadway hit Gypsy takes you on a grand vaudeville tour. It sweeps you up in the roller-coaster relationship of Louise (Natalie Wood), the wallflower later to blossom into sophisticated stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, and her ambitious mother, Rose (Rosalind Russell who's performance won her a fifth Best Actress Golden Globe Award). Karl Malden scores as Herbie, the salesman who falls for Rose - to his exasperation. Full of terrific tunes (Everything's Coming Up Roses and Small World among them), Gypsy will certainly entertain you and definitely make you smile.

Special Features: 2 Outtake Musical Numbers: You'll Never Get Away from Me (Duet Version) and Together Wherever We Go.

Directed By Mervyn LeRoy
Starring Rosalind Russell, Natalie Wood, Karl Malden

Directed and written by Barbara Sonneborn
Featuring Xuan Ngoc Nguyen, Barbara Sonneborn

""The cumulative effect of superbly integrated interviews and archival footage is staggering, easily as terrifying as anything found in Saving Private Ryan...wisely allows the ravaged faces and grainy footage of dead children to speak for themselves.""   
— Variety

Regret to Inform superbly portrays the lasting devastation of the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of women, both American and Vietnamese, who lost their husbands. This is the story of one woman's journey to Vietnam, twenty years after her husband was killed there, and the women she encounters who were affected by the war.

READ MORE....

Hoping to find some closure for her pain and loss, Barbara Sonneborn wants to see and feel the places where her husband spent his last days. By intercutting emotional testimonials from women on both sides of the war who share their suffering, she makes us understand how real this war remains. Through seeing many different women's perspectives, we recognize how their emotions contrasted: helplessness on the part of those in the United States versus inevitable participation by North and South Vietnamese women.

A very powerful, yet quiet, film, Regret to Inform develops a yet-unseen perspective: that of those left behind. Focused on Vietnamese and American women, the film is filled with exceptional interviews which are revealing and poignant. Testimony to Sonneborn 's uncommon ability is the remarkable level of honesty and openness the women are willing to share on camera. The viewer is taken on an uncommonly well-crafted journey, which includes beautiful camerawork and a seamless mixture of new and archival footage. Deeply personal and vastly universal, Regret to Inform is an involving and moving lesson about the painful legacy of war.

REVIEWS

""Regret To Inform may claim an unusual point of view, but the anguish it uncovers is familiar from numerous previous accounts of the war. That it's the same tragic story however you come at it may in fact be the most enlightening aspect of this film.""   — Village Voice

""While recognizing that war has its heroic aspect - witness the fortitude and resilience of the widows - [Regret to Inform] also implies that the terrible price of that nobility is one that nobody should have to pay.""  — New York Times

""Unlike the traditional documentary that seeks to impart information and keep emotion largely in check, Regret to Inform is frankly personal and explicitly emotional.""  — San Francisco Chronicle

Cushing, along with several other members of the cast, had also starred in the original version (the role of Tom Friend in the television play was taken by Stanley Baker).

The film was produced by Hammer Film Productions and released on 26 August 1957 in the UK. It was subsequently released in the United States and throughout the world.",80752,236,29,PT1M42S,0

It sounds so simple, yet in 1966 a young filmmaker named Bruce Brown captured the essence of a sport as never before. To stand atop a crescendo of water, to ride on nature's all powerful wave feeling the speed and spray accelerate with each moment, and to embrace a lifestyle uniquely connected to a single word: surfing. The film was THE ENDLESS SUMMER. Now, Bruce Brown and filmmaker son, Dana, have created an all new classic, featuring never-before-seen footage from THE ENDLESS SUMMER. Embark on a journey of adventure, discovery, and the incredible challenge of facing a fifteen foot wall of water as the sport's greatest surfers look back on the thrills, the spills, and the movie that uniquely embraced the lifelong search for that shining beach, that glowing sunset, that perfect wave.",812014,1397,72,PT1M24S,0

Released without an MPAA seal, it helped liberate subsequent films from the rigid strictures of the production code. Elmer Bernstein's jazz score and Saul Bass's title graphics were similarly groundbreaking.

Sunshine is an award-winning 1999 historical film directed, written and produced by István Szabó. It follows three generations of a Jewish family during the changes in Hungary from the beginning of the 20th century to the period after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. The central male protagonist of all three generations is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes.

2462,#NAME?,Karyn Kusama on NEAR DARK (Trailer Commentary),"For her second film, director Kathryn Bigelow's original intention had been to make a revisionist western, but when it became apparent nobody was funding horse operas in 1987 she and co-writer Eric Red decided to turn their project into a genre hybrid--a vampire western. Aside from Curse of the Undead (1959), Billy the Kid Meets Dracula and Jesse James vs. Frankenstein's Daughter (both 1966), that concept had been pretty much unexplored.  Boxoffice returns were unexciting, but it found an appreciative audience on video. A modern remake co-written by Bigelow started shooting in 2007 but remains uncompleted, having been put on hold due to its similarity to the Twilight series.

Battleship Potemkin  
Synopsis
For eight decades, Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 masterpiece has remained one of the most influential silent films of all time. This all-new restoration -- available for the first time in 35mm -- restores dozens of missing shots, all 146 title cards, and Edmund Meisel's definitive 1926 score, returning the film to a form as close to its creator's bold vision as has been seen since the film's triumphant Moscow premiere.

The original take-off cult classic from the highly successful team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker (Airplane, The Naked Gun), this ""uproariously funny [film]"" (TV Guide) launched a thousand laughs and serves as a precursor to the raunch-fests of the '80s and the blockbuster success of the Farrelly Brothers films. Directed by the legendary John Landis (Animal House, The Blues Brothers), The Kentucky Fried Movie features a lewd, loosely connected collection of skits that spoof blaxploitation films, news shows, porno movies, TV commercials, kung fu flicks and more!


Including well-known stars such as Bill Bixby, Donald Sutherland, Tony Dow, George Lazenby and Henry Gibson, this one-of-a-kind film features over 22 gut-bustingly hilarious segments including:

""Cleopatra Schwartz""
""The Wonderful World Of Sex""
""Catholic High School Girls In Trouble""
""A Fistful Of Yen""
And More!

The Department of Justice hires him to stage the murder of a gangster about to enter the Witness Protection Program. He agrees, but then things get complicated. Meanwhile, New York City police detective Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy) is investigating the faked murder and cannot understand why the Justice Department is even less helpful than usual. [1]

Unknown to Mildred, John has secretly embarked on a series of murders, killing young brides on their wedding nights because with each murder, his memory comes closer to revealing the traumatic event that branded him a dangerous psychotic.

2496,pSPje5KXj2E,"""On Our Merry Way"" -Stewart, Fonda & MacMurray","This was a real curio of a movie... James ""Slim"" Stewart and Henry Fonda were long time friends and roommates in NYC in their halcyon Broadway stage days, and here they are together in 1948 in a nearly forgotten little comedy called ""On Our Merry Way"", an episodic comedy tied together with Burgess Meredith's character playing a reporter doing a story about Children. In this scene Hank and Jimmy are musicians traveling with a ragtag band in a beat up old bus. Down on their luck they happen on an aspiring horn player (Played here by Carl ""alfalfa"" Switzer, who had a tiny role 2 years earlier with Jimmy Stewart in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as a  Mischeivous high school kid who opens up the dance floor to drop the dancing kids into the swimming pool~!)  
 
Here, Carl plays a young ""Hepcat"" who dreams of a life traveling with such a band. 
Dig his way-out rendition of ""You must have been a beautiful Baby"" as he plays along with the great Harry James. ""Beat me, Daddy!""
Stewart and Fonda are way too ""unhep"" to be real Jazz bohos, and it's still too early in 1948 to give much creedence to the new Jazz phenomenon called BeBop. They play a safe, watered down form of Swing. Yet, it is still a pleasure to see these real life pals onscreen together (in spite of their growing postwar political differences) at the young ages of 40 and 43. James Stewart would never seem this young again.
 
 
Here's another segment of the 1948 film that shows Fred MacMurray in an early comedic role along side his future TV costar in ""My Three Sons"", William Demarest, who would play Uncle Charlie 12 years later for the duration of the show (after a season with William Frawley, of course). Fred started out as a leading man only to discover he had a gift for light comedy. Look at his adroit handling of these magic tricks. Although MacMurray and Fonda starred together in their earliest roles, the Technicolor film, ""trail  of the Lonesome Pine"", it's too bad Fred and his real life friend James Stewart weren't in any scenes together in this one. Their's might have been a cinematic teaming that could have really thrived!

The doctor has gone into retirement after the trauma of having an autistic child under his care commit suicide. 

Thus, when approached by local sheriff Michael Rivers (J.T. Walsh) with a request that he try to get through to an autistic nine-year-old boy Tim Warden (Ben Faulkner), who likely witnessed and possibly committed the double murder of his parents, he initially demurs. 

However, he puts aside his reservations after hearing that another psychologist, Dr. Harlinger (John Lithgow), intends to drug the boy into revealing the truth. When police entered the murder scene, they had found, along with the bloody victims, the boy brandishing a knife, and his teenaged sister Sylvie (Liv Tyler), cowering in the closet. 

Since the girl saw nothing, Rainer begins to work slowly and patiently with this boy who has never spoken, using a method based on the fact that the the autistic mind thinks in terms of rote sequences. He also gains the trust of the haunted Sylvie, and gradually the children unfold their tale of terror.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Chick (Bud Abbot) and Wilbur (Lou Costello) accidentally awaken Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolf Man.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
It seems that Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), in league with a beautiful but diabolical lady scientist (Lenore Aubert), needs a ""simple, pliable"" brain with which to reactivate Frankenstein's creature (Glenn Strange). The ""ideal"" brain belongs to the hapless Lou Costello, whom the lady doctor woos to gain his confidence and lure him to the operating table. Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), better known as the Wolf Man, arrives on the scene to warn Costello and his pal Bud Abbott of Dracula's nefarious schemes. Throughout the film, the timorous Costello witnesses the nocturnal rituals of Dracula and the Monster, but can't convince the ever-doubting Abbott--until the wild climax in Dracula's castle, where the comedians are pursued by all three of the film's monstrosities. As a bonus, the Invisible Man (voiced by an unbilled Vincent Price) shows up for ""all the excitement.""

2587,lM1o1xe5FGE,Creature from the Black Lagoon (trailer),"Creature from the Black Lagoon is a 1954 monster film directed by Jack Arnold, and starring Richard Carlson, Julia Adams, Richard Denning, Antonio Moreno, and Whit Bissell. The eponymous creature was played by Ben Chapman on land and Ricou Browning in underwater scenes. The film was released in the United States on 5 March 1954.

Creature from the Black Lagoon was filmed and originally released in 3-D requiring polarized 3-D glasses, and subsequently reissued in the 1970s in the inferior anaglyph format (this version was released on home video by MCA Videocassette, Inc. in 1981). It is considered a classic of the 1950s, and generated two sequels, Revenge of the Creature and The Creature Walks Among Us, each a year apart. Revenge of the Creature was also filmed and released in 3-D, in hopes of reviving the format.

After considering 100 projects for a successor to The Music Man, Willson found one that was irresistible. And unsinkable. Debbie Reynolds plays the title role, inviting all to Belly Up to the Bar, Boys for the whoop-and-holler film of Willson's 1960 Broadway hit. Reynolds won a 1964 Best Actress Oscar® nomination as the backwoods heroine who survives the Titanic and the snobbery of Denver society. Screen-debuting Harve Presnell reprises his stage role of Johnny, who has heartful-and-a-half of love for Molly. Johnny wasn't alone. Astronauts Gus Grissom and John Young so admired the movie they named their Gemini 3 spacecraft Molly Brown.

Before Night Falls (2000) Official Trailer - Javier Bardem, Johnny Depp Movie 

Episodic look at the life of Cuban poet and novelist, Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990), from his childhood in Oriente province to his death in New York City. He joins Castro's rebels. By 1964, he is in Havana. He meets the wealthy Pepe, an early lover; a love-hate relationship lasts for years. Openly gay behavior is a way to spite the government. His writing and homosexuality get him into trouble: he spends two years in prison, writing letters for other inmates and smuggling out a novel. He befriends Lázaro Gomes Garriles, with whom he lives stateless and in poverty in Manhattan after leaving Cuba in the Mariel boat-lift. When asked why he writes, he replies cheerfully, ""Revenge.""

There she stumbles upon the discovery of her life - a treasure trove of ancient Scots-Irish ballads, songs that have been handed down from generation to generation, preserved intact by the seclusion of the mountains. With the goal of securing her promotion, Lily ventures into the most isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs and finds herself increasingly enchanted - not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the raw courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harshest conditions. It is not, however, until she meets Tom - a handsome, hardened war veteran and talented musician - that she's forced to examine her motivations.

The United States armed forces were at their highest state of readiness ever and Soviet field commanders in Cuba were prepared to use battlefield nuclear weapons to defend the island if it was invaded. Luckily, thanks to the bravery of two men, President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev, war was averted. 

The year is 1962. USAF U-2 spy planes discover that the USSR is placing nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba. The Chiefs of Staff warns President Kennedy and his cabinet that the missiles have the potential to kill up to 80 million Americans, and destroy a large number of USAF bomber bases, crippling the U.S. ability to retaliate and leaving the country an easy target for Soviet invasion. Fortunately, the missiles are not yet operational, and the President and his staff try to figure out how to get the missiles out of Cuba, whether by diplomatic means or by force.

* Plot:
Lincoln High's A-Cheerleading Squad is your typical group of mall-going, pizza-eating, boy-chasing 21st century American teenagers living on the edge of perfection. Sure, each member has her foibles. Diane, the captain of the squad who is madly in love with Lincoln High star quarterback Jack Bartlett, has nuclear-powered enthusiasm. Hannah is righteously born-again. Kansas, the rebel whose mother is doing time in the local prison, can't help but talk trashy. Lucy is a geek obsessed with going to Harvard. And Cleo has fantasies of stalking Conan O'Brien. High school is mostly heaven for these paragons of teenage bliss - until Jack and Diane find themselves in an unexpected adult situation, and in desperate need of extra cash. In order to help their friend Diane, the A-Squad goes where no cheerleader has gone before: taking on a little after-school project known as bank robbery. But like five Bonnies without a Clyde, the A-Squad does things their way - with a little sugar and a lot of spice.

Ivan Reitman, producer of National Lampoon's Animal House and producer/director of Ghostbusters, brings you Big Shots, a slam-bang comedy-adventure with a heart as big as Chicago. It centers on the unlikely but very special friendship that develops between two 11-year-old boys. Obie is a kid from the lily-white suburbs struggling with the recent death of his father while Scam is a product of the inner city, streetwise but equally alone. Together they share an odyssey full of outrageous humor and riveting excitement that teaches them that it's character and love, note size, age or stature, that truly makes someone a big shot.

Robert Mandel, director of FIX, has give Big Shots a percolating rhythm that maintains a deft balance between the story's scares and surprises and its warm, knowing exploration of two boys on the brink of manhood. With a sterling supporting cast, this is a film the whole family will enjoy.

PLOT:
The story returns to the Brody family in Amity Island. Martin Brody had died of a heart attack, although his widow, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), claims that ""it was the fear [of the shark] that killed him."" She discusses with her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), and his fiance Tiffany (Mary Smith), arrangements for the Christmas season. Now working as a police deputy in Amity, Sean is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy. As he does so, he is attacked by a shark. He is killed as his screams are drowned out by the carol singers on the island.
Ellen is convinced that the shark had deliberately targeted Sean due to some evil curse, and visits her eldest son, Michael (Lance Guest), in the Bahamas. Michael now works as a marine biologist. Fearing he will be attacked next by the shark, Ellen hopes to convince him to take up a new job on dry land. She meets Hoagie (Michael Caine), and they begin dating. Michael's wife Carla (Karen Young) is an artist and one day during her art exhibit, Ellen's granddaughter Thea (Judith Barsi) asks if she can go out on a banana boat with her friend Margaret and her mother (Diane Hetfield). The shark attacks the boat with Thea on it. The shark ends up devouring Margaret's mother in the process with blood flying everywhere, leaving Thea unharmed, but in a state of shock. Ellen becomes convinced that the shark has tracked her family to the Bahamas. She takes a boat out to sea on her own, intent on confronting and killing the shark to break the curse, or sacrificing herself hoping the shark will leave her family alone.


The shark leaps out of the water to attack Jake (Mario Van Peebles)
Hoagie flies Michael and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) out to sea so that they can find Ellen quickly. Hoagie lands the plane on the sea, but the shark sinks it. Looking out for the shark while using a device that emits electromagnetic impulses to drive the shark mad, Jake moves to the end of the prow. The shark unexpectedly leaps from the surface of the water to grab Jake, biting into him and dragging him beneath the surface in a gory fashion. The device causes the shark to repeatedly leap out of the water and Ellen steers the boat directly for the shark, impaling it on the broken bowsprit, which somehow causes it to explode. After killing the shark, they find Jake mauled but alive. Near the end of the film, Ellen is relieved that the curse of the shark is no longer on her family. The film ends as Hoagie flies Ellen back to Amity Island.",642299,615,325,PT1M5S,0

Can love bridge the gap between Earth and Heaven? Moviemakers have thought so for decades. And the pursuit of eternal bliss has never been so sly, engaging or magical as when Timothy Hutton and Kelly McGillis strike up a romance Made in Heaven. Deceased drifter Mike (Hutton) arrives in Heaven and quickly falls for newborn soul Annie (McGillis), soon to start her assignment on Earth. When Annie leaves, Mike follows, risking all to find her in her new identity with neither having memories of their previous celestial existence. Maureen Stapleton, Amanda Plummer and an array of star cameos highlight what director Alan Rudolph (Afterglow, Welcome to L.A.) calls a good old-fashioned fairy tale of destiny and love. Watch and feel like youre on Cloud Nine (Joel Siegel, Good Morning America/ABC-TV).

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Desmond (Martin Short) is thrilled when the opening number of his musical based on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" goes off without a hitch.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Ben Foster stars in this teenage comedy as Berke Landers, an average high schooler who has achieved high status by winning over Allison (Melissa Sagemiller), reputed to be the most popular and beautiful girl in his class. After an initially winning time, Allison finds herself drawn to the hot new guy in school, leaving Berke in the lurch. At the risk of ruining his unsteady reputation, Berke concocts a scheme for getting Allison back: he will join the school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream and prove his romanticism to her. Realizing he needs an effective acting coach, he turns to Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), who was once the annoying little sister of a best friend and has suddenly blossomed into a grownup -- to whom Berke finds himself drawn. Berke must then decide if getting Allison back is the ultimate priority, as he falls for the more sensible Kelly, all while trying to maintain a credible presence both in school and in his new acting gig. Get Over It also features R&B singer Sisqo, comedian Martin Short, and Shane West in supporting roles.

In this seductive spy thriller based on the best-selling novel by John Le Carré, Academy Award®-winner Geoffrey Rush (1997, Best Actor, Shine) delivers a dazzling performance as Harry Pendel, an ex-con turned tailor to the rich and infamous and married to smart and sexy Luisa (Jamie Lee Curtis - True Lies). Directed by Academy Award®-nominee John Boorman (Hope and Glory, Deliverance) and set in steamy Panama, where nothing is what it seems, Andrew Osnard (Pierce Brosnan -- The Thomas Crown Affair), a suave and ruthless British spy, entices Harry into eavesdropping on the powerful politicians he clothes.

Behind bars for what could be a life sentence, Alex subjects himself to a solitary existence, his spirit crushed by the cramped prison cell. A terrible tension tightens every muscle in his body with a frustration equaled only by his father's rage. Both are ready to explode. There's one way out of prison for Alex, and that's in the hands of the parole board. But there is a way out of his self-imposed solitary with the help of a young woman he thought he'd never see again. It's something to live for. Something to die for.

2804,hoLodMR6DAY,Les Feluettes / Lilies (1996) - Movie Trailer,"* Winner of the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture (aka the Canadian Oscars) 

One of the most successful gay indie films of the '90s, Lilies won four Canadian Genie Awards® (the equivalent of the American Oscars®) including Best Picture, and won critical acclaim worldwide. 

John Greyson's Lilies is an emotionally intense, suspense-laden tale of love, betrayal and revenge in which one man's past comes back to haunt him and another man's past comes to bring him freedom.

In 1952, Catholic Bishop Bilodeau (Marcel Sabourin, Sum of All Fears) makes an exceptional in-person visit to a prison to hear a dying inmate's last confession. Once in the confessional, the Bishop is confronted by his childhood friend, Simon (Aubert Pallascio, 3 Needles), who collaborates with his fellow inmates to take the Bishop hostage and re-enact Simon's version of the events that led to his murder conviction forty years earlier, in their rural village, of young Vallier.

This flashback story centers on two boys who are madly in love with each other. Young Simon (Jason Cadieux) and Vallier (Danny Gilmore) are cast in a school play about Caesar meeting St. Sebastian. And young Bilodeau, a closeted man secretly in love with Vallier, tries to be close to his love but sees Simon as an obstacle. The action moves back and forth, seamlessly through time, between the crude prison and the actual events of 1912, culminating in the tragic night when both men's fates are decided and their true love is lost forever.

More’s the pity because Wise’s film, about a machinist’s mate caught up in the Chinese civil war of 1926, is an ambitious attempt to examine both political and personal conflicts against an intriguing historical backdrop. Steve McQueen stars as the rebellious sailor alongside Richard Attenborough whose romance with a Chinese courtesan comes to a tragic end.

Back home, Henry confronts his unrequited passion for his high school best friend and his feelings about being gay in a small town. But, as we quickly learn, Big Eden residents defy the stereotype of ""small town, small minds."" 

As Henry works through his emotions, the townspeople quietly conspire to help him along, until Henry realizes new possibilities for both friendship and romance. 

""Big Eden"" is a uniquely American fable about home and family. It hits upon the universal longing and hope we each have for finding a place where we are loved, and the unconditional desire to see those that we love find happiness.",18337,61,1,PT2M53S,0

McKenzie is presented as the first and greatest innovator of modern cinema, single-handedly inventing the tracking shot (by accident), the close-up (unintentionally), and both sound and color film years before their historically documented creation. The film also shows fragments of an epic Biblical film supposedly made by McKenzie in a giant set in the forests of New Zealand, and a 'computer enhancement' of a McKenzie film providing clear evidence that New Zealander Richard Pearse was the first man to invent a powered aircraft, several months prior to the Wright Brothers.
The film also shows a (staged) premiere screening of a recovered McKenzie film presented by film promoter Lindsay Shelton.

mit Götz Gorge, Christian Redl, Jeanette Hain, Felix Eitner u.a.

Der großspurige, aber liebenswerte Zobel (Götz George), sein Lebenspartner Karl (Christian Redl) und Zobels Tochter Lizzi (Jeanette Hain) haben als Taschenräuber-Trio die besten Tage hinter sich. In ihrem klapprigen Wohnmobil fahren sie von Stadt zu Stadt, klauen und werden beklaut, streiten sich und wollen nicht wahrhaben, dass es so nicht weiter geht. 

Als Karl durch einen Verkehrsunfall ausfällt, tritt der junge, naive Rudolf in das Leben von Vater und Tochter -- und macht beiden schöne Augen. Verwicklungen, Konflikte und Enttäuschungen sind vorprogrammiert -- oder gibt es doch ein Happy-End für das Trio?

Für viele überraschend, besetzte Erfolgsregisseurin Hermine Huntgeburth die Rolle des schwulen Kleinganoven Zobel mit „Deutschlands Lieblings-Macho"" (Berliner Zeitung) Götz George. Mit ihm schuf sie, noch überraschender, eine völlig klischeefreie, bührende, originell erzählte Tragikkomödie über Menschen, die mit Charme, Herz und trockenem Witz ihr Leben am Rande der Gesellschaft meistern. Mittlerweile ist DAS TRIO ein Klassiker unter den deutschen Komödien der 1990er Jahre.

Tomb Raider was the first major Hollywood film to shoot in Cambodia since Peter O'Toole starred in Lord Jim in 1964. The Tomb Raider crew were all set to travel to China to film the Terracotta Army coming to life, when the sequence was pulled at the last minute, as it had already been featured in a Chinese movie. Cambodia was next on the list and Hanuman Films was chosen for scouting at Angkor. Following a successful scout with a full technical crew, Paramount British Pictures appointed Hanuman Films as their local servicing partner in the Kingdom of Cambodia.
  
Kulikar Sotho worked as Local Liason Manager, essentially Line Producer, arranging all filming permissions, script approval, temporary import/re-export of equipment, visas, accommodation, transport and catering for the production. Nick Ray worked as Location Manager on the film, selecting locations for the shoot, building a photographic inventory of the temples used in shooting, approving all sets or alterations to be made at each site and working with local authorities every step of the way to ensure this first sensitive shoot at Angkor passed without incident.
  
Hanuman Films also took responsibility for recruitment of extras, recruitment of site security, recruitment of humpers and labourers and recruitment of a large team of interpreters (some turned out to be more like interrupters, but most acquitted themselves well!). 

Tomb Raider premiered on June 15th 2001 at Mann's Theatre in Los Angeles. Nick and Kulikar were both invited to the premiere and stayed with Producer Lloyd Levin for a long weekend of partying.

It was written in July 1945 in Hollywood, California during one of the hottest days on record.  First recorded by Vaughn Monroe, it became a popular hit, reaching number one on the Billboard music chart the following year.  Due to its seasonal lyrics, it is commonly regarded as a Christmas song. Yet despite its cheery, holiday feel, it is a love song that never mentions Christmas.

Oh the weather outside is frightful
 But the fire is so delightful
 And since we've no place to go
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

 It doesn't show signs of stopping
 And I've bought some corn for popping
 The lights are turned way down low
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

 When we finally kiss good night
 How I'll hate going out in the storm!
 But if you'll really hold me tight
 All the way home I'll be warm

 The fire is slowly dying
 And, my dear, we're still goodbying

Jeff Daniels plays a mild-mannered IRS agent caught in the orbit of a flaky small time thief played by Melanie Griffith. The film proceeds as a funny, quirky rom-com á la Howard Hawks’ Bringing Up Baby until the arrival of Griffith’s sociopathic ex-husband, played by Ray Liotta, when things take an abrupt turn toward the dark side. The movie’s eclectic soundtrack, a Demme trademark, reinforces the film’s roller coaster mood swings.

2907,4clwgHEOYMo,X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (Trailer),"X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes is a 1963 science fiction/horror film. Directed by Roger Corman from a script by Ray Russell and Robert Dillon, the film stars Ray Milland as Dr. James Xavier. A world renowned scientist, Dr. Xavier experiments with X-ray vision and things go horribly wrong. While most of the cast are relatively unknown, Don Rickles is notable in an uncharacteristically dramatic role. Veteran character actor Morris Ankrum makes an uncredited appearance, his last in the movie industry.

Shot in a mere three weeks on an ultra-slim budget of $300,000, Corman described the film's success as a miracle. The movie was notable for its use of visual effects to portray Dr. Xavier's point of view. While crude by later standards, the visuals are still effective in impressing upon the audience the bizarre viewpoint of the protagonist.

Vom deutschen Erfolgsteam Bernd Eichinger (Produktion) und Uli Edel (Regie), farblich restauriert und erstmals auf Video-on-Demand.

Die 13-jährige Christiane F. lebt zusammen mit ihrer Mutter und Schwester in einer trostlosen Hochhaussiedlung in Berlin-Gropiusstadt. Um wenigstens zeitweilig den Familienproblemen zu entkommen raucht sie Hasch und wirft Trips. Doch dann steigt sie auf harte Drogen um und nimmt Heroin. Sie wird süchtig. Morgens geht sie in die Schule und nachmittags auf den Kinderstrich am Bahnhof Zoo, um sich das Geld für ihre Sucht zu beschaffen. Immer weiter gerät Christiane in den Sog aus Drogen und Prostitution. Und statt der vermeintlichen Freiheit bringt der Stoff nur Verfall und Tod, der auch einige ihrer engsten Freunde nicht verschont 

""Die 13-jährige Christiane F. lebt in Berlin und erlebt die soziale Misere der Familie, aus der sie wenigstens zeitweilig mit Tabletten entkommen will. Sie wird süchtig. In der Schule wird sie durch ihre Clique im Konsum bestärkt. Bald steigt sie auf harte Drogen um und nimmt Heroin. Obwohl sie ihren Freund Detlef liebt, mit ihm ein Konzert von David Bowie besucht, wird sie zur Prostituierten und steht vor dem endgültigen Abstieg. Sie versucht, von der Droge loszukommen, was ihr nach etlichen vergeblichen Anläufen gelingt.

""Christiane F."" war einer der deutschen Kinoerfolge der achtziger Jahre und Bernd Eichingers Durchbruch als Produzent. Der Stoff basiert auf Tonbandprotokollen der 15-jährigen Christiane, die den ""Stern""-Reportern Kai Hermann und Horst Rieck ihre Geschichte vortrug und die Verfilmungsrechte zusammen mit ihnen an Eichinger verkaufte. Das Problem des Drogenmissbrauchs wird in der Genauigkeit der Beobachtungen im schmutzigen Milieu deutlich, das Lebensgefühl der Abhängigen authentisch eingefangen."" (www.video.de)

Michael J. Fox is electrifying in a powerful tale of excess and redemption from bestselling author Jay McInerney and Oscar® winning producer Sydney Pollack (Out of Africa). Jamie Conway (Fox, Back To The Future) is an aspiring writer who leaves his home town in Kansas for the dynamic cityscape of Manhattan in an attempt to fuel his career and inform his writing experience. But the seductive side of life gets under his skin. The party culture enlivens his nights with hedonistic joy as he surfs a wave of excess that deadens his pain and wires his senses. In his charge to live life to the absolute limit, Jamie alienates his friends and family and risks losing everything.
Capturing the spirit of an era with a thumping soundtrack the film features a solid support from Kiefer Sutherland (24), Phoebe Cates (Drop Dead Fred) and Dianne Wiest (Parenthood).",97431,339,66,PT1M26S,0

Starring as these plucky FBI recruits are gangbuster comediennes Rebecca de Mornay (Risky Business, Wedding Crashers) and Mary Gross (Saturday Night Live, A Mighty Wind). ""Brawny"" Ellie and ""brainy"" Janis go together like ham and eggs, and their lives will be hilariously scrambled during their hilarious, hectic training. Janis must learn physicality and intimidation techniques, while Ellie needs a guiding hand to help get through the intricacies of constitutional law. So in true buddy fashion, they'll help each other prepare for the academy's final exam: a ""simulated crime exercise"" that chauvinistic lunkheads think will separate the men from the girls.

In Milagro, a small town in the American Southwest, Ladd Devine plans to build a major new resort development.

It is a remake of the 1939 film The Magnificent Fraud, based on the unpublished short story entitled ""Caviare for His Excellency"" by Charles G. Booth.

The film follows the exploits of Jack Noah (Dreyfuss), who is filming in the small, fictional South American country of Parador when the Paradorian president-for-life suddenly dies of a heart attack. Not wanting to lose his position in power, the president's right-hand man, Roberto Strausmann (Raul Julia) forces Jack to take the 'role of a lifetime' - that of the dead president, as the two men look so much alike. Jack accepts, eventually winning over the people and even the dead president's mistress, Madonna (Sonia Braga). However, when paradise proves to be too boring, Jack needs to find a way to get out while keeping Roberto out of the loop.

The ""bad boys of magic"" go over the edge in this mind-blowing, role-switching comedy murder mystery set in the dizzying world of Altlantic City casinos. In a TV interview, Penn mentions his idea of a fun practical joke: ""I wish someone were trying to kill me. It would give focus to my life, excitement. I'd be like James Bond."" Twenty-million people hear him. One decides to deliver a punchline he'll never forget. Made by people who thought Psycho was a comedy, Penn & Teller Get Killed (they also wrote the piece) features Caitlin Clarke as the femme fatale and David Patrick Kelly as the Edgar Allan Poe-esque nutcase with a new mission. Arthur Penn, known for hip masterpieces like Bonnie and Clyde, Alice's Restaurant and Little Big Man, directs with roller-coaster pacing and subversive intelligence.

Directed By Arthur Penn
Starring Penn Jillette, Teller, Caitlin Clarke

She decides to hitchhike home, but on a whim, she ends up in Venice instead.

Her plans to return the next day are thwarted when she misses her train and does not have enough money to buy another ticket. Soon she is gainfully employed at a flower shop run by an irascible old anarchist. Though her teenaged sons do not seem all that bothered by their mom's absence, Rosalba's husband grows increasing agitated at the interruption in his routine, so he hires a bumbling detective to track her down.

Featuring wall-to-wall verbal and physical wit, Skin Deep tops itself with a scene that, even today, remains glowingly funny and original. “I can’t describe it to you.

The Hotel New Hampshire Trailer - Directed by Tony Richardson and starring Rob Lowe, Paul McCrane, Beau Bridges, Seth Green, Wally Aspell. John Irving's picaresque black comedy about an eccentric and unusually peripatetic family in a film starring Rob Lowe as John Berry, the family's oldest son. John's father, Win (Beau Bridges), is obsessed with hotels, so he buys a run-down seminary in New England, transforming it into the Hotel New Hampshire. The extended family includes the profanity-spouting Franny (Jodie Foster); Lily (Jennifer Dundas); a dwarf, Frank (Paul McCrane), who is gay; John, who is strongly attracted to his sister; Egg (Seth Green), the youngest boy; and Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley), Win's father. After a number of tragic incidents, including the gang rape of Franny, are seen through the special lenses of black comedy, the family is invited to take over another hotel in Vienna, courtesy of their friend Freud (Wallace Shawn). Richardson elicits fine performances from his talented cast in this wild ride through the mind of John Irving.

Complete title:
The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat ... Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade

Cast:
         Ian Richardson as Jean-Paul Marat
         Patrick Magee as Marquis de Sade
         Glenda Jackson as Charlotte Corday
         Susan Williamson as Marat's mistress
         Clifford Rose as Asylum director

production:
         Royal Shakespeare Company

Directed by:
        Peter Brook

Based on the play by:
         Peter Weiss

The Marquis de Sade is locked in the Charenton mental hospital and decides to put on a play. His overseers agree as long as he follows certain conditions. He writes and directs the other mental patients in a play based on the life of the Jean-Paul Marat. As the play progresses, the inmates become more and more possessed by the violence of the play and become extremely difficult to control. Finally, all chaos breaks loose. 


Awards: 
         Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists 1969 
         Won Silver Ribbon Best Director -- Foreign Film Peter Brook 
         Locarno International Film Festival 1967
         Won Special Mention Peter Brook 


Whether it's based on reality or not, Marat/Sade is an ambitious idea. The Marquis de Sade (Patrick Magee), often wrote and produced plays during his incarceration. Whether he made one about Jean-Paul Marat is debatable and this is certainly not based on anything Sade wrote. Marat/Sade is actually a filmed version of a play written in the early 1960s (and fully titled The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat As Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of The Marquis de Sade) by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Ian Richardson plays the bathtub-bound Marat, and Glenda Jackson plays his assassin. The only problem, of course, is that in the world of the film, Richardson is a lunatic paranoid and Jackson is a narcoleptic depressive. This makes for some strange interpretations of history, mental illness, heroism, and politics — and where we draw the lines among all these things. In the end, Marat/Sade comes off as more of a joke than a think-piece, unfortunately. We laugh at the participants instead of pitying them. We don't think about history and its interpretation: We think instead about what kind of royal person would willingly subject themselves to a presentation of this play. The chaos that erupts is completely expected. Better idea: Have a group of royals present a play inside a mental institution, and see how the inmates respond...",1745177,3756,184,PT1H58M8S,0

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The horny teen heroes of American Pie (1999) return for further raunchy antics in this comedy sequel written by the first film's creator, Adam Herz. Returning home following their freshman year of college, old friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Oz (Chris Klein), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Stifler (Seann William Scott) rent a summer house on Lake Michigan where they hope to score romantically. However, complications ensue due to Jim's relative lack of experience, requiring an interlude with a fellow student and a visit to his old friend Michelle (Alyson Hanigan), who's now a band camp counselor, all in preparation for the return of Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). In the meantime, Oz is separated from Heather (Mena Suvari) by a trip abroad, Finch has another encounter with Stifler's mom (Jennifer Coolidge), and Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) is as clueless as ever about his son's love life. Director J.B. Rogers served as first assistant director on the first film and made his directorial debut with Say It Isn't So (2001).

3106,M3lLNzTSRPo,Corelli's Mandolin Italian Trailer,"Tratto da un libro e una storia vera.
Film dedicato ai caduti Italiani e Greci in Cefalonia durante la guerra.
L'isola di Cefalonia subisce l'invasione dell'esercito italiano tra cui c'è il Capitano Antonio Corelli che s'innamora della bellissima Pelagia, figlia del medico del villaggio. La guerra si avvicina e Antonio e Pelagia devono scegliere tra la fedeltà ai loro rispettivi paesi ed il loro amore, per il quale dovranno affrontare enormi difficoltà e inevitabili sacrifici prima di giurarsi eterna devozione.
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a 2001 film directed by John Madden and based on the novel of the same name by Louis de Bernières. It stars Nicolas Cage and Penélope Cruz. The film was panned by critics on its release and disappointed fans by deviating somewhat from the plot of the novel, with many of the book's tragic episodes softened.
The main characters are Antonio Corelli, an Italian captain, and Pelagia, the daughter of the local physician, Dr. Iannis. An important event in the novel is the massacre of Italian troops by the Germans in September 1943.The idyllic beauty of Greece's Mediterranean islands has been invaded by Italy, bringing legions of soldiers to the once tranquil island of Cephallonia. Captain Antonio Corelli, an officer with an irrepressibly jovial personality and passion for the mandolin, initially alienates a number of the villagers, including Pelagia. The daughter of the village doctor, Pelagia is an educated and strong-willed woman, and while at first offended by the Italian soldier's behaviour, she slowly warms to his certain charms as they are forced to share her father's home.
When Pelagia's fiance, a local fisherman, heads off to war, the friendship between Antonio and Pelagia grows even stronger. Her beauty and intelligence have captured his heart and his fondness for the village's vibrant community causes him to question his reasons for fighting. Antonio becomes a part of the lives of the villagers, but the moment is fleeting. As the war grows ever closer, Antonio and Pelagia are forced to choose between their allegiance to their countries and the love they feel for one another-a love which must overcome tremendous odds, and endure the inevitable sacrifice which accompanies eternal devotion.

3113,Ew0ALiiBmlg,Happy Accidents - Movie Trailer,"Ruby Weaver has man trouble: she tries to fix them, so she's stuck herself with a string of losers. Her current lover, Sam Deed, seems different: he's sweet, tender, just in from Dubuque. But, as Ruby tells her therapist about Sam, in flashbacks we see someone not quite of this world. In fact, Sam informs Ruby that he's from the future, 2470 to be exact, traveling back in time to avoid prosecution for his sister's death, and to find Ruby, whose photo he saw back home. Ruby's sure he's delusional, but most of the time she wants to keep him - and maybe fix him. Although he seems sane, maybe Sam hasn't told her the real story: what's he up to, and who is Chrystie Delancey?

Almost as soon as he arrives in the city, high-school dropout Johnny (Jesse Bradford) finds himself victimized at the slot machines by a slick little vixen. 

His journey to glory on the racetrack thus sidetracked, he soon falls in with a group of hoods and street urchins. Befriended by solicitous hustler Steven (Jordan Brower) and condescended to by gay-for-pay stud Eric (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), Johnny gets a quick introduction to the sleazy Vegas landscape. 

At first he rejects his new acquaintances, but after a disastrous liaison with a buxom young lady (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen), he finds himself the reluctant new best friend of the besotted Steven. Adamantly professing his own heterosexuality, Johnny tries to find female clients to bankroll his ticket out of town. But soon Eric arrives, promising big bucks from his wealthy male patrons, setting the stage for conflict with Steven and unexpected bloodshed. 

Shown during the Panorama program at the 1999 International Berlin Film Festival, Speedway Junky was the debut feature from writer/director Nickolas Perry. Daryl Hannah co-stars as an older ex-prostitute who serves as a sort of foster mother for both Johnny and Steven. 

The film also marked the acting debut of musical artist Warren G and features a cameo appearance from Patsy Kensit.",4815,21,2,PT2M41S,0

Burns, who also wrote and produced the film, stars as Tommy Reilly, a boy from Queens turned successful Manhattanite. After being kicked out of the apartment he shared with his girlfriend, he is back in the dating scene. When he meets a divorced schoolteacher, the connections between the additional main characters in the ensemble are identified slowly but surely: a divorced couple, an adulterous married man and his mistress, and a doubting wife. Burns' look at relationships leaves no stone unturned as the main characters and their friends discuss their love lives. Filmed throughout New York City, the characters' stories are spliced together by their own personal monologues in documentary-style scenes. Well-delivered, witty, and humorous banter that is reminiscent of the works of Woody Allen keeps the story moving, as does the shooting technique of following behind the characters with the camera. Tucci, in particular, delivers a standout performance as a two-timing, lecherous dentist.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A couple experiences love at first sight and leaves it up to destiny to bring them back together again.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After the long-delayed Town and Country, director Peter Chelsom turns in his second 2001 effort with this love-at-first-sight romantic comedy that revolves around fate, destiny, and chance. Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) are two New Yorkers already in relationships when they meet one another, each reaching for the last pair of cashmere gloves at a department store. Over coffee, they strike up an intimate conversation, and Jonathan thinks they should see each other again. Unconvinced, Sara arranges an elaborate series of ""fate"" games; if they're meant to be together, she reasons, she and Jonathan will receive some sort of sign in the future. Flash forward several years, and the two are at opposite ends of the country -- Jonathan in New York and Sara in San Francisco, both engaged to be married. Still, neither can shake the memory of their chance encounter, and they both enlist their best friends (Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven) to help them find their true love again. Serendipity had its Gala World Premiere at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.

Trailer is in my oppinion nicely done with fine music background and atmospheric voice narration.  Movie is worth it - especially if you like martial arts movies in wuxia style and watch the Platinum edition that includes many bonuses and infos about HK cinema and cast. This one is really one of HK LEGENDS :-).

Iron Monkey is a 1993 Hong Kong movie by director and martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo Ping (later become widely famous in the west through his Matrix work). Produced by Tsui Hark.

For this breathtaking epic adventure set in late Ching dynasty, acclaimed action director Yuen Woo-ping combines incredible dynamic, high-flying fight-action and stunning cinematography with a classic wuxia story of courage, honour and sacrifice. 

International action superstars Donnie Yen and Yu Rong Kwong give nice performances as two legendary warriors who must put their lives on the line to defeat the barbaric excesses of a corrupt political regime and protect the lives of the people and child who later becomes ""The Legend"" Wong Fei Hong. 

The DVD with many nice bonuses in this Platinum edition is worth seeing. Movie is not as ambitious as ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, including some comedy sequences but avoiding non-sensical sense of humour. Despite its qualities, Iron Monkey was unfortunately a flop at the HK box office.

From an early age, Beverly displays a keen intelligence and an interest in literature, and dreams of going to college in New York and becoming a writer. However, she also develops an early interest in boys, and at 15 finds herself madly in love with a boy from her high school.

Beverly and Ray end up making out, and after one thing leads to another, Beverly discovers she's pregnant. Telling Ray is only marginally less difficult than informing her parents, and at 16, Beverly is a wife and mother. Against the odds, Beverly is determined to still finish high school and go on to college, but that goal becomes more difficult with time, especially after Beverly's marriage begins to fall apart.

Built around intimately-told personal stories of Hasidic and Orthodox Jews who are gay or lesbian, the film portrays a group of people who face a profound dilemma -- how to reconcile their passionate love of Judaism and the Divine with the drastic Biblical prohibitions that forbid homosexuality.


""Tremendo Antes de Deus"" é um documentário sem precedentes que abala os pressupostos sobre a fé, a sexualidade, e o fundamentalismo religioso.

The story begins with badly wounded crimelord Tommy Gibbs (Fred Williamson) escaping an assassination attempt masterminded by corrupt District Attorney DiAngelo (Gerald Gordon) with the help of his estranged father, Papa Gibbs (Julius Harris). When DiAngelo's thugs attempt to kill him, Papa fights back and joins his son's criminal organization, a move that angers Gibb's top henchman Zach (Tony King). As Tommy and Papa build up their criminal empire, Zach secretly plots against them with DiAngelo. Zach also murders Helen (Gloria Hendry), Tommy's traitorous ex-wife, and pins in it on Papa to drive a wedge between them. Tommy gives up his New York crime operation and runs off to California. Papa takes over the operation, only to get killed by Zach during a fistfight. Angered by his father's death, Tommy returns to settle the score with Zach and DiAngelo. Hell up in Harlem delivers plenty of action set pieces and did fairly well at the box office, but lacks the consistency and the dramatic punch that made Black Caesar so memorable. As a result, it is considered to be one of Larry Cohen's lesser efforts. ~ Donald Guarisco, All Movie Guide",70708,279,24,PT2M9S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a small village in the Shire a young Hobbit named Frodo (Elijah Wood) has been entrusted with an ancient Ring. Now he must embark on an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval ""Middle-earth"" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the ""One Ring,"" a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson's native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).

_____________________________________________________________
It's the off-season at the lonely Beauregard Hotel in Bournemoth, and only the long-term tenants are still in residence. Life at the Beauregard is stirred up, however, when the beautiful Ann Shankland arrives to see her alcoholic ex-husband, John Malcolm, who is secretly engaged to Pat Cooper, the woman who runs the hotel. Meanwhile, snobbish Mrs Railton-Bell discovers that the kindly if rather doddering Major Pollock is not what he appears to be. The news is particularly shocking for her frail daughter, Sibyl, who is secretly in love with the Major. (Patrick Sullivan, Imdb)

- Forget What You Think You Know
- The Champ is here!

Will Smith spent approximately one year learning all aspects of Ali's life. These included boxing training, Islamic studies and dialect training (to help him speak like Ali). Smith has said that his portrayal of Ali is his proudest work to date.

One of the selling points of the film is the realism of the fight scenes. All of the boxers in the film are in fact former or current world heavyweight champions. It was quickly decided that 'Hollywood fighting' - passing the fist (or foot) between the camera and the face to create the illusion of a hit - would not be used in favor of actual boxing. The only limitation placed upon the fighters was for Charles Shufford (who plays George Foreman). He was permitted to hit Will Smith as hard as he could, so long as he did not actually knock the actor out.

Muhammad Ali from 1964 to 1974, told in three braided threads. The boxer: from becoming champion to regaining the championship. Religion and politics: Cassius Clay becomes a Black Muslim, truncates a friendship with Malcolm X, perhaps is Elijah Muhammad's pawn, refuses induction into the US military, and faces a five year prison sentence while his case goes to the Supreme Court. Family: he marries twice and by 1974 marriage two is strained, defends his white trainer, has a brother in Bundini Brown, and is wily with Howard Cosell. Throughout, Ali keeps his own counsel: in the ring, at the induction center when he won't step forward, and in friendship, love, and victory.

In 1964, a brash new pro boxer, fresh from his olympic gold medal victory, explodes on to the scene, Cassius Clay. Bold and outspoken, he cuts an entirely new image for African American's in sport with his proud public self confidence with his unapologetic belief that he is the greatest boxer of all time. To his credit, he sets out to prove that with his highly agile and forceful style soon making him a formidable boxer who soon claims the heavyweight championship. His personal life is no less noteworthy with his allegiance to the Nation of Islam, his friendship with the controversial Malcolm X and his abandonment of his slave name in favour of Muhammad Ali stirring up controversy. Yet, at the top of his game, both Ali's personal and professional lives face the ultimate test with the military draft rules are changed, making him eligible for military induction during the Vietnam War. Despite the fact that he could easily agree to a sweetheart deal that would have meant an easy tour of duty for himself, Ali refuses to submit on principle to cooperate in an unjust war for a racist nation that treated his people so poorly. The cost of that stand is high as he finds himself unable to legally box in his own country while his case is contested in court. What follows is a battle for a man who would sacrifice so much for what he believes in and a comeback that would cement his legend as one of the great sports figures of all time.

Smith had to gain a significant amount of weight to look the part of Muhammad Ali. His current physique is due to the weight gains he had to make for Ali.

3286,_DTswS-j8U4,Presque Rien / Come Undon (2000) - Movie Trailer,"'Presque Rien' ('Come Undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director Sébastien Lifshitz (with the collaboration of writer Stéphane Bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'Wild Side'). As we come to understand Lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable. By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now, time passed, time reflective, time imagined, time alone - Lifshitz makes his tales more personal, involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses. It takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film.

Mathieu (handsome and gifted Jérémie Elkaïm) is visiting the seaside for a holiday, a time to allow his mother (Dominique Reymond) to struggle with her undefined illness, cared for by the worldly and wise Annick (Marie Matheron) and accompanied by his sister Sarah (Laetitia Legrix): their distant father has remained at home for business reasons. Weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of Mathieu alone, looking depressed, riding trains, speaking to someone in a little recorder. We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.

While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him, and we can feel Mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion. The youth Cédric (Stéphane Rideau) follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction. Soon Cédric approaches Mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession. Mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking, rebuffs Cédric's public approaches, but continues to seek him out for consignations. The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, so very necessary to understanding this story, is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes. Yet as the summer wears on Mathieu, a committed student, realizes that Cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival. It becomes apparent that Cédric is the Dionysian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one: in a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while Cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking.

Mathieu is a complex person, coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father, a fear of his burgeoning sexuality, and his nascent passion for Cédric. Their moments of joy are disrupted by Cédric's admission of infidelity and Mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways. Time passes, family changes are made, and Mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt. The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace, strangely enough, in one of Cédric's past lovers Pierre (Nils Ohlund) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.

After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful. Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passion's powers found in love, and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative. Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making. In French with English subtitles. Highly Recommended.

Patrick Swayze plays the concerned commander who befriends English-speaking refugee Tai Tran (Don Duong) and hires him as camp manager. His little nephew Minh (Trung Nguyen) and niece Anh (Jennifer Tran) are anxiously awaiting the arrival of their mother, who was left behind during the evacuation. Fortunately, Minh finds a friend in the camp cook (Forest Whitaker), and together they paint a colorful mural on the kitchen wall. Meanwhile, another refugee, Duc (Billinjer Tran), tries hard to embrace the American way of life, but finds heartbreak when he discovers his lost love (Kathleen Luong) is also at the camp, now the second wife of another man. Time passes and everyone listens to the fall of Saigon over the radio while waiting to be assimilated, like it or not, into their strange new homeland. Directed by Timothy Linh Bui, this is a stately, mournful series of vignettes that brings healing attention to an aspect of the Vietnam War some may have forgotten.

Scratch starts with an origin story. Grand Wizard Theodore (the ""Thomas Edison of the movement"") recalls the day, way back in 1975, when his grandmother told him to turn down the music he was making in front of his Bronx River Houses apartment. In order to hear her, he put his hand on the turntable, holding the record in place. As he moved his hand, slightly, a new sound rose up. And so, he smiles, scratching was born.

3355,xrULisYzCpw,Jessica Bendinger on THE BAD NEWS BEARS,"Michael Ritchie’s 1976 comedy about a squad of underachieving Little Leaguers and their boozing coach (played by a rumpled Walter Matthau) is a bracing antidote to most of today’s carefully vetted family-friendly feel good films. Ritchie’s uniquely warmhearted but unsentimental take on his crew of misfits allows even the most peripheral of characters their own memorable moments. Rowdy, profane and, happily, avoiding the cheap theatrics of the triumphant finale usually found in sports films, The Bad News Bears is yet another wonderfully unruly example of the lost, lamented 70s cinema. Forty years later, The Daily News chats with cast and crew on  the  anniversary of Ritchie’s film.

The screwball who-will-marry-who antics of The Philadelphia Story are given a gay update for the 90's in this deliriously romantic comedy. Bob (Arquette) has a mad crush on college frat boy room-mate Brendan (Maelan). Brendan finds out, freaks out and sleeps with Sarah.

Five years later they and college chums all reunite for a wedding. As everyone parties and consumes just enough booze, libidos are inflamed and inhibitions are lowered.

Is the bedroom-eyed Brendan really longing for Bob? Will Sarah bed Brendan, if only for old times' sake? Will Sterling marry Bob and get his hoped-for themed wedding? The disastrous possibilities make for great, hilarious comedy.",49901,120,3,PT2M9S,0

Dueling Banjos. Woody Allen. The Muppet Show. Johnny Carson. Jersey Boys. If you don't know what they have in common, it's time you made the acquaintance of Marshall Brickman. Fresh from his successful series of screenplay collaborations with Woody Allen (Sleeper, Annie Hall, Manhattan) musician and comedy scribe Brickman moved into the director's chair with Simon. The tale of a brainwashed psychologist (played by the great Alan Arkin) who gets boondoggled by a group of geniuses in a think tank who would rather amuse themselves than solve global problems. They manage to convince Simon that he is really a space alien, but Simon gets away from them, taking refuge in a commune led by a former television executive (Adolph Green) who worships TV Guide. And soon the Army is after the escaped ""alien"" with orders to shoot on sight. Featuring Wallace Shawn, Fred Gwynne, and Madeline Kahn.

Directed By Marshall Brickman
Starring Alan Arkin, Madeline Kahn, Austin Pendleton

In the 1850s two British officers, Captain Richard Burton (Patrick Bergin, Patriot Games), a womanising anthropologist and Lt. John Speke (Iain Glen, Game of Thrones), an aristocrat with a pending book deal, embarked on an awe-inspiring adventure to discover the source of the great Nile River.
 
Warned of the many dangers ahead of them, the two pioneers attempted to make history, as the first ever Westerners to venture deep into the untamed African wilderness and document their findings. Along the way, their exploits become the stuff of legend - experiencing a fearsome lion attack,  challenged by the complexities of communicating with the natives and observing the sheer beauty and grace of the greater African landscape.
But as the difficult journey takes its toll on the two intrepid explorers, their friendship is tested to the limits of conflict and pushed to the point of betrayal.
 
Based on William Harrison's epic historical novel, directed by Oscar® nominee Bob Rafelson (Five Easy Pieces) and with breathtaking photography from nine-time Oscar® nominee Roger Deakins,  Mountains Of The Moon also features Richard E.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Connie (Diane Lane) learns that she is not the only woman in Paul's (Olivier Martinez) life.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Diane Lane is a wayward wife and Richard Gere is her suspicious husband in Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful. Connie (Lane) leaves her suburban home on an errand, venturing into Manhattan during a wicked windstorm. On a trash-strewn Soho street, she literally runs into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a handsome young Frenchman carrying a huge stack of books. Connie has a bad scrape on her knee, and is unable to get a cab, so Paul invites her up to his apartment. Paul is quietly flirtatious as he gives Connie some ice and a bandage for her knee. Connie phones home and explains to her son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), that she's running late. Before she leaves, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. She mentions the encounter in passing to Edward (Gere), her husband, but it's clear that she's obsessing about Paul, and soon she's back in the city, with a pretext for calling him up. Soon, they are lovers, and they grow bolder and bolder in their passion. Edward begins to suspect, and eventually gets a private investigator (Dominic Chianese of The Sopranos) to follow Connie. His worst fears confirmed, Edward decides to confront Paul, a decision that will come to haunt him. While the screenplay for Unfaithful is credited to Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) and William Broyles Jr. (Cast Away), the inspiration for Lyne's film came from Claude Chabrol's acclaimed 1969 film La Femme Infidele.

Omar is now engaged to marry Tania and Johnny, jealous, runs off. Omar tracks him down and orders him to get back to work as the laundrette needs to stay open round-the-clock to make money. Papa Hussein, mistakenly turns up for the opening ceremony at 3am instead of 3pm. He confronts Johnny about his fascist past when Johnny had marched through the streets and racially taunted him.
What does Papa's conversation say about the change in culture that's taken place in Britain during the early years of the 1980s? Why is he so concerned with Johnny and Omar's continued education? What might Omar's running of the laundrette be a symbol of, considering the era in which the film was produced?",18945,46,1,PT3M34S,0

Look for essential character actors Christopher Lloyd, Robert Forster and Dick Miller in supporting parts, but don’t look for much in the way of accurate period detail.

3490,ssBUir2LG-U,The Importance of Being Earnest (2002) - Trailer,"Original Trailer of the movie, based on the well known comedy by Oscar Wilde ""The Importance of Being Earnest""
 
The plot revolves around two men in Edwardian England, John (Jack) Worthing and Algernon (Algy) Moncrieff. Whenever Jack travels to London from his Hertfordshire estate he says he is going to see his (fictitious) wayward brother Ernest. Once in London he keeps his privacy by calling himself Ernest. This tactic is especially important as his beloved, Gwendolen, declares that she could only love a man named Ernest. Her cousin, Algy, is the one person who knows Jack's secret and one day he travels down to the estate, announcing himself to Jack's attractive ward Cecily as the infamous Ernest. Cecily is enamoured with him and his name, and upon Jack's return home and Gwendolen's unexpected arrival it becomes clear there are both too many and too few Ernests earnestly courting.  (Wikipedia ENG)

Very well done movie in my opinion, with two of the best english actors, Colin Firth and Rupert Everett, both perfect here in their roles! but we have not to forget the co-stars Reese Whiterspoon, Frances O'Connor and Judi Dench!!
Funny and enjoyable! (look out for the song the two men start singing to the ladies)

--- sum ppl get me wrong for liking this movie, truth is its too heart-wrenching even sumwot disturbing, but 1st time i seen it-- i never tried to watch it again. the music vid is just a tribute since it didn't have a OST given that its so obscure anyway.  

For those pplz who are wondering like me--- If ever they were reunited?

My conclusion is ""NO"". As he was a soldier he could have been killed or died naturally of age.

This is based on 'true life' story so reading the book if u can find it is a good idea.

For a Lost Soldier (Voor Een Verloren Soldaat) is a 1992 Dutch film based upon the autobiographical novel of the same title by ballet dancer and choreographer Rudi van Dantzig. It deals with the romantic / sexual relationship between a 12-year-old boy (Dantzig) and a Canadian soldier during the final months leading up to the liberation of Holland from Nazi occupation during World War II.

Jeroen (Jeroen Krabbé) reminisces about the time in 1944 when he (Maarten Smit) and other children were sent to the countryside by their parents to escape the war. The city suffers from food shortages, with more food available in the country. He stays with an eel fisher's family, but despite the abundance of food, he is plagued by homesickness.

Things change when the village is liberated by Canadian troops. Jeroen meets Walt Cook (Andrew Kelley), a Canadian soldier in his early 20s, who befriends him. Jeroen revels in the attention the soldier showers on him, and eventually their relationship becomes sexual. His foster parents are aware of the closeness between Jeroen and the soldier, but it is unclear in the film whether they are aware of the sexual nature of the relationship.

After a few more days, Walt's troop are ordered to move and Walt leaves without saying goodbye to Jeroen. Jeroen is heartbroken, having only a photo to remind him of the soldier. After the war is over, he returns to his family back in Amsterdam, where he decides to go to America later in his life.

They're unable to settle their account, which when the movie begins stands at about six thousand pounds, because Jake, a speculator, has blown all his money on a bad investment. Jake and Tina are unmarried and have no permanent address; they're charming, attractive drifters, getting by on style. In a sense, they're throwbacks to the sophisticated and slightly disreputable couples who floated airily through thirties romantic comedies: no-strings types who stick together for the best shallow reasons-for sex and laughs and the shared kick of living the high life without having to work too hard. The picture, written and directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, is conceived as high-style fluff, but it never delivers quite as much irresponsible fun as it promises. It's like a Lubitsch movie without the speed and the grace and the blissful inconsequentiality. Malkovich, however, is as unaccountably magnetic here as he was in ""Dangerous Liaisons."" His performance is a postmodern mutation of thirties style, an ungodly hybrid of William Powell and Boris Karloff, and it's sensationally funny. This is as original a piece of acting as you'll ever see in a romantic comedy. The supporting players are an unusually lively group: Lolita Davidovich, Peter Riegert, Joss Ackland, and Bill Paterson.",57721,98,8,PT2M18S,0

Unknown to him, the three are nuns in street clothing who want to aid the community but are afraid the local residents might be reluctant to seek help if their true identities were known.
Carpenter falls in love with Sister Michelle Gallagher, played by wholesome Mary Tyler Moore, but Sister Michelle's true vocation remains unknown to Dr. Carpenter.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Christopher Gill (Rod Steiger) attacks Kate Palmer (Lee Remick) in her apartment while Morris Bummel (George Segal) is on his way to rescue her.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
New York detective Moe Brummell (George Segal) is assigned to track down a serial killer who has been preying on lonely middle-aged ladies. Each of the bodies is discovered with a lipstick kiss drawn on the forehead. We know (but Brummell doesn't) that the murderer is Christopher Gill (Rod Steiger), a round-the-bend actor whose hatred for his mother has driven him to his killing spree. Gill is fond of adopting a different personality and costume with each killing (a priest, a homosexual, a plumber etc.), making him doubly difficult to trace. When Brummell comments to the media that he's up against a criminal genius, he finds himself the reluctant recipient of Gill's anonymous phone calls, wherein the killer plants cryptic clues leading to his next crime. It may not be readily apparent from the previous sentence, but No Way to Treat a Lady is a comedy-albeit a jet-black one. Moe Brummell is hampered with an archetypal Jewish mamma (Eileen Heckart), who in her own way is as deadly as the elusive Christopher Gill. Lee Remick plays Brummell's girl friend, who, as the only person who might be able to identify Gill, is placed in harm's way at the film's climax. A curious by-product of No Way to Treat a Lady is the fact that Rod Steiger was cast in the lead in the 1976 biopic W.C. Fields and Me on the basis of the third-rate Fields imitation he offers to George Segal during one of his taunting phone calls.

As luck would have it, they land on Halloween and get mistaken for trick-or-treaters. Comedy ensues as the Martians try to get taken seriously. 

When one saucer of an invasion force has engine trouble, it lands on Earth. It happens to be Halloween and it happens the invaders are only about 4 feet tall. As the bumbling aliens wander around the countryside they are taken to be children and they make friends with two children, one of whom is the daughter of the sheriff.

Brothers Johnny, an adolescent surf talent, and Adam, a preadolescent video-game addict, grow up care-free in California as adopted sons of Marines veteran Mac, inseparable friends of wacky local lout Iggy. Colonel Chi's military reign of terror culminates in their tiny birth-land, island state Patu San, off the Viet Nam coast. Former royal guards officer Zatch comes to summon the brothers to return and restore the pacific monarchy, because they are the sons of the murdered king, whom Mac took in exile for safety. They are joined on the adventurous journey by a bored Californian police detective whose attention was drawn by the ninja team that failed, thanks to Zatch, to murder the brothers in Mac's home.

3605,BmHQjE_YCGw,Murnau's TABU (Story of the South Seas) Masters of Cinema Trailer,"In 1929, F. W. Murnau (Nosferatu, Faust, Sunrise), one of the greatest of all film directors, invited leading documentarist Robert Flaherty (Nanook of the North, Man of Aran) to collaborate on a film to be be shot on location in Tahiti, a Polynesian idyll in which Murnau imagined a cast of island actors would provide a new form of authentic drama and offer rare insight into their ""primitive"" culture. The result of their collaboration was Tabu, a film that depicts the details of indigenous island life to tell a mythical tale that is rich in the universal themes of desire and loss.

Subtitled ""A Story of the South Seas"", Tabu concerns a Tahitian fisherman (played by an islander, Matahi) and his love for a young woman (played by fellow islander Reri, who went on to star on Broadway) whose body has been consecrated to the gods, rendering her tabu as far as mortal men are concerned. The lovers flee their island and its restrictive traditions, but will their love prevail in the ""civilised"" world?

This Oscar-winning film (the Academy Award went to cinematographer Floyd Crosby) is both poetic and simple in tone. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present -- completely unc-ensored and fully restored -- this landmark film of rare exoticism and magical beauty, described by critic Lotte Eisner in 1931 as ""the apogee of the art of the silent film"", for the first time ever on Blu-ray in its original aspect ratio.

3616,k1wpI9YMmeY,Le Fate Ignoranti / His Secret Life (2001) - Movie Trailer 3,"Film making is not about bringing together photography and theater, but painting and music. So said Robert Bresson, and Turkish director (but living and working in Italy) Ferzan Ozpetek shows how this is possible. Anna (a young and rich widow living a sheltered life, admirably played by Margherita Bui) discovers her deceased husband (with whom she was truly in love) had a gay lover. She traces this man, and discovers a whole world she had not dreamed of - just a few kilometers from home. She mourns her marriage for the second time, and is both repulsed and attracted by the former lover and his friends (living in a semi-incredible commune which FerzanOzpetek creates and describes in flourishing details). In the end she accepts this separate reality, discovering it inside herself as well as outside.

At the beginning I was fascinated by the technical talents of Ferzan Ozpetek, and how he interprets other directors without actually copying them: the general atmosphere of the gay commune reminds me of Pedro Almodovar (the costumes, for example, and the terrace in Rome like the one in Madrid in Women on the verge of nervous breakdown). The way of picturing the streets of this old, lower-class area of Rome reminded me of Mario Martone and his film L'amore Molesto. By the time I realized the biggest debt is to Julian Shnabel's Before Night Falls I was so much into the film that I did not care any more, and simply let myself being carried away by the magic of emotions. At the end I left the cinema totally dazzled. (There is a brief scene when Antonio is looking for condoms and unexpectedly finds a poetry book which for me is worth many a therapy sessions discussing sex and affection).

I cannot guarantee that this will happen to you as well, but you are certain to see a film full of art, by that rare director who established himself (Turkish Bath was his first film) not by marketing savvy but by word-of-mouth from casual viewers becoming enthusiastic supporters.

By the way: the connection with Before Night Falls is clear in two points. Both films surprise viewers with emotional documentary footage when the ending titles are showing. Here it is about the year 2000 Gay Pride march in Rome (a national confrontation after the Vatican and the left-wing prime minister tried to have it banned or moved somewhere else).

The second point is even more clear: in both films there is a scene (and a very moving one) where soft, melancholic music is used (apparently out of context) under footage of a loud and roaring party. In Le Fate Ignoranti the two main characters look at each other with romantic longing - while both are engaged (actively or passively) in overtly sexual courting with other partners. Loneliness hidden in apparent merriment is exactly what Shnabel wanted to show, as well.

Moonlight Mile is a 2002 movie written and directed by Brad Silberling. This film was loosely inspired by writer/director Brad Silberling's own experience. He was dating actress Rebecca Schaeffer at the time she was killed by an obsessed fan in 1989. It was partially filmed on location in South Pasadena, California, Swampscott, Massachusetts, Marblehead, Massachusetts and Gloucester, Massachusetts. Neighbor's Restaurant is really Haley's Liquor Store in Old Town Marblehead, Massachusetts.

The film takes its name from the Rolling Stones song ""Moonlight Mile"". The film's original title was Baby's in Black, and then later changed to Goodbye Hello, and then the current title. The film is set in 1973 and music from that era is heavily featured, including that of the Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan and Elton John, transmitting a feeling of the times.

3621,HXU9W41mSb4,Shanghai Ghetto Official Film Trailer,"One of the most amazing and captivating survival tales of WWII, the overwhelmingly acclaimed SHANGHAI GHETTO has been declared ""a don't miss documentary...powerful...eye-opening"" (New York Observer). Stirringly narrated by Academy Award winner Martin Landau (Ed Wood, The Majestic), SHANGHAI GHETTO recalls the strange-but-true story of thousands of European Jews who were shut out of country after country while trying to escape Nazi persecution in the late 1930s. 

Left without options or entrance visas, a beacon of hope materialized for them on the other side of the world, and in the unlikeliest of places, Japanese-controlled Shanghai. Fleeing for their lives, these Jewish refugees journeyed to form a settlement in the exotic city, penniless and unprepared for their new life in the Far East. At the turn of the new millennium, filmmakers Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amire Mann boldly snuck into China with two survivors and a digital camera to shoot at the site of the original Shanghai Ghetto, unchanged since WWII. Their never-before-seen recordings--along with interviews of survivors and historians, rare letters, stock footage, still photos, and an orignal score by Sujin Nam and Chinese Erhu performer Karen Han (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)--depicts an incredibly moving portrayal of a rich cultural life, bravely constructed under enormous hardship.",16700,56,6,PT1M59S,0

Special Agent Will Graham is called out of retirment by the FBI to assist in capturing a killer who calls himself ""The Great Red Dragon"". After failing to solve the case, Graham knows he must face his deepest fear and consult the man who attempted to kill him several years earlier: Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant, caged monster who was famous for his horrific crimes of cannibalism. Lecter seems willing to assist Graham with the case, however, the vengeful genius has more sinister plans in store for the seasoned agent.

Based off of the first terrifying novel by Thomas Harris: See Hannibal Lecter as he was introduced in the series!

TRIVIA:
*A movie called ""Manhunter"" was released in 1986, starring William Petersen (Gil Grissom: CSI), and Brian Cox (Mr. Striker, X Men 2) that was based off of the Red Dragon book. Petersen played Will Graham in the movie, while Cox played Hannibal ""Lecktor"".

*While filming this movie, Hopkins was channel surfing one day and came upon Silence of the Lambs on AMC. He then realized that he had used a different voice for Silence of the Lambs then he was using for filming during this movie. He stated in an interview that he was praying that no one would notice it ^.^' (Fans did, of course)

*Hopkins has stated that this Lecter is his favorite one out of the three that he's done.

*Hopkins wasn't sure if he wanted to do Lecter for this movie. He'd had enough of the character by HANNIBAL, which was released a year earlier.

*The same guy that designs the tattoos in the TV show Prison Break designed the massive tatoo that the killer has on his back in this movie.

*Hopkins had to lose 25 lbs for this movie, and for part of Hopkins' appearence, the original plan was to digitally de-age him so he would look younger than his Silence of the Lambs counterpart. This plan was discarded for unknown reasons, but most people have stated it was a budget issue.",1272839,1532,182,PT2M35S,0

Director: Nello Rossati
With Franco Nero, Donald Pleasance, William Berger, Christopher Connelly, Miguel Carreno, Consuelo Reina
Screenplay: Franco Reggiani, Nello Rossati
Cinematography: Sandro Mancori
Music: Gianfranco Plenizio

Django was a successful and highly influential ""spaghetti western,"" spawning over 30 pseudo-sequels that borrowed the name and the main character's bloodthirsty ways, but Django 2: Il Grande Ritorno (aka Django Strikes Again) was the first follow-up to feature Franco Nero reprising the title role from the original film, and the only one made with the participation of the director of Django, Sergio Corbucci (though only in an advisory capacity.) In this story, Django (Franco Nero) has spent a decade in a monastery, trying to live down his violent past as a gunman. However, Django is forced to renounce his vows when word gets back to him that a villainous slave trader, Orlowsky (Christopher Connelly), has kidnapped his daughter. Enraged and determined to bring the abductors to justice, Django digs up his old Gatling gun (literally - he had buried it in a graveyard, under a headstone with the name ""Django"" on it) and once again begins cutting a swath through the countryside as he seeks to free his daughter.

I remember the exact day I fell in love with Hip Hop. (...). Little did I know how much Hip Hop would be a part of my life. (...). Hip hop was as young, naive... confused... sometimes innocent, and sometimes as mischievious as I was.  And as I grew up, Hip Hop grew with me... and along the way it took on all my baggage, my dreams... I felt Hip Hop and Hip Hop felt me.  And I know that everyone who loves the music feels the same way I do.  

For many people Hip Hop was that first friend... the first to talk to us, the first to understand.  Hip Hop has always been that kind of friend to me. And like any relationship... I watched it grow, I watched it change.

The union of Hip Hop to the mainstream... was a hard thing to imagine.  Hip Hop was always this personal regional thing that belonged to just me. Starting with ""Fab 5 Freddie"" and Yo! MTV Raps!  Anyone with a television set and cable box could get a piece of hip hop.  I knew I was gonna have to share... and that was hard to get used to.

Just when you think you know everything there is to know about Hip Hop, it finds a way to surprise you... and remind you why you fell in love in the first place.

So what is the difference between ""Rap"" and Hip Hop?  Its simple... Its like the difference between saying you love somebody... and being in love with somebody.  ""Rap"" is just a word!

I always thought... One day I would outgrow my relationship with Hip Hop.  I never thought it was a ""fad"" like many, but I never thought it could grow and mature.  I thought it would be an adolescent memory I'd look back on... like a crush on the captain of the football team.  But I realize we have more than that... much more.  We have a history... a friendship... We listen to each other... We laugh together... We finish each others lyrics. I dont have to pretend with Hip Hop, and Hip Hop doesnt have to pretend with me.

A highly regarded inclusion to Oprah's Book Club, Janet Fitch's international bestselling novel White Oleander is a heartbreaking study of manipulation and the conviction of love in a life filled with uncertainty.
""Love humiliates you...hatred cradles you."" So echoes the words of cold-hearted matriarch Ingrid Magnussen (Oscar nominee Michelle Pfeiffer, Hairspray). Her violent crime of passion not only places her in jail but sends her fifteen year-old daughter Astrid (Alison Lohman, Drag Me To Hell) on a trajectory of turmoil and self-discovery. In and out of three foster homes in as many years, Astrid's life is a circus of emotions, finding value and worth in the people and places that both surround and confound her. Stretching the ties that bind ever so thin, Astrid struggles with acceptance and her ability to forge an identity and independence within her ever-changing environment.

Also featuring Oscar winner Renée Zellweger (Chicago) and Robin Wright Penn (Forrest Gump), White Oleander captures the essence of belonging and asks the haunting question - where does a mother's love end and a daughter's life begin?",379139,1809,135,PT2M38S,0

瓦依達電影《鐵人》 1981年  波蘭
Janek Wiśniewski [ˈjanɛk viɕˈɲɛvski] is a fictional name given to a real person in the poem Ballad of Janek Wiśniewski.

The name was invented by the author Krzysztof Dowgiałło to symbolize an 18-year worker killed in the Polish city of Gdynia by the military or police on December 17, 1970, during the Polish 1970 protests. The image of an anonymous young man's body carried on doors through the cordons of police and tanks inspired Dowgiałło to write the poem. Not knowing his name at the time, the author decided to give him a name that is typically Polish. Later it was discovered the man was actually named Zbigniew Godlewski and lived in nearby Elbląg. In 1970 he was shot dead along with some 40 other people.

The legend was popularized in the late 1970s by a song by Mieczysław Cholewa, Pieśń o Janku z Gdyni, and by Jacek Kaczmarski in his Ballada o Janku Wiśniewskim (the song which was performed by Krystyna Janda during the closing credits in the Andrzej Wajda's 1981 movie Man of Iron). After the fall of communism in Poland, a street was named after Zbigniew Godlewski and another after Janek Wiśniewski.

English translation

Boys from Grabówek, boys from Chylonia

Paul, un joven y talentoso estudiante de música es contratado en San Francisco para pasar las páginas de la partitura en un concierto de Richard Kennington, uno de los pianistas más famosos del mundo. Además de diligente, Paul es extremadamente atractivo, hecho que no pasa desapercibido para Kennington y su agente Mansourian, dos hombres en la cima de sus respectivas carreras. Kennington y Paul vuelven a encontrarse en Barcelona, donde el joven está de vacaciones con su madre, Pamela, que intenta olvidar el trastorno producido por el abandono de su marido. Paul y Kennington se enamoran, pero este amor tiene implicaciones muy distintas para los dos hombres. Kennington regresa a su casa precipitadamente, huyendo de un mayor compromiso en la relación. Al mismo tiempo, Pamela empieza a recuperarse y a ganar la confianza perdida mientras se da cuenta de que Paul ha dejado de ser un niño.

A su regreso a los Estados Unidos, Paul descubre que su carrera no se desarrollará como hubiera deseado, sencillamente porque no tiene suficiente talento para ser concertista y se deja llevar por la vida cómoda de Nueva York. Pamela luchará por el futuro su hijo y la experiencia vivida servirá a madre e hijo para aprender a construir una relación más profunda. Manjar de Amor es la historia de estos ingenuos personajes y su despertar a la dura realidad de la vida.
------------------
Paul, a handsome and talented music student is employed as the page-turner at one of the world famous pianist Kennington´s concerts in San Francisco. Not only is Paul diligent but also extremely attractive, a fact noticed by Kennington and his agent Mansourian, two men at the top of their chosen careers. Kennington and Paul meet again in Barcelona, where the boy is on holiday with his mother, Pamela, who is trying to get over her husband leaving her. Paul and Kennington fall in love but this has very different implications for both men. Kennington rushes back home escaping from commitment. Pamela, meanwhile, begins to recover her self-confidence but Paul is no longer a child.

Back in the United States Paul learns that his musical career is not going to progress as desired; he simply is not talented enough. Paul and Pamela will learn through their living experience how to build a deeper relationship. Food of Love is the story of these two simple characters awakening to the harsh reality of life.

Plot:
A bag full of symbolic folklore about werewolves, or, rather, their sexual connotation. Granny tells her granddaughter Rosaleen strange, disturbing tales about innocent maidens falling in love with handsome, heavily eyebrowed strangers with a smoldering look in their eyes; about sudden disappearances of spouses when the moon is round & the wolves are howling in the woods; about babies found inside stork eggs, in a stork nest high up a tree; etc., etc. Of course the story of Little Red Ridinghood is also present, with a very handsome he-wolf! (And of course this he-wolf consumes Grandmother, but 'consumes' Little Red Ridinghood). All the stories are somehow reducible to loss of innocence, and fear of/hunger for (a newly acquired sense of) sexuality; their Freudian character is mirrored in their dreamlike shapes. This movie is not really a horror movie; it's more a multiple tale about growing up into adolescence.",218086,910,100,PT2M55S,0

3745,tne7D73Zmqg,Ararat Official Trailer!,"Filmmaker Edward Sorayan is making a non-documentary movie recounting the 1915 Armenian genocide by the Turks. This movie will be controversial if only because of the denial by the Turkish government that the genocide even exists. Regardless, Sorayan plans on using what he considers real life events and people as the basis for the movie. One character added late into the screenplay is Armenian painter Arshile Gorky. The filmmakers hire an art historian named Ani, an expert on Gorky's life, as a consultant for the film. Ani is currently having problems in her own family as her stepdaughter Celia accuses her of being the direct cause in the death of Celia's father/Ani's second husband. Celia even resorts to public outbursts to guilt Ani to tell what Celia believes to be the truth about the death. This public disagreement places Ani's son, Raffi, in an awkward position as he is Celia's lover. As filming occurs and the story of the Armenian genocide is told, Raffi travels to the former Armenia - now Turkey - to discover truths about his cultural past and his family's more immediate past. Upon his return from Turkey, Raffi has problems reentering the country, which leads to Raffi recounting much of his time in Turkey and exactly what is in the film reel canisters to the questioning customs agent named David, who has his own indirect connection to the movie.",42383,134,24,PT1M34S,0

Bobby Fine (Ryan O'Neal) teaches comparative literature at a New England university. His father Jack (Jack Warden) is a hard-luck 7th-Avenue dress merchant in heavy debt to a 7-foot loan shark (Richard Kiel). To pay up, Jack gives up the business -- and babe-in-the-woods Bobby finds himself part of the deal. Exposed to the craziest business in midtown, Bobby's solution is the next best thing to indecent exposure: debuting a line of see-through jeans! Soon he's in full tryst with the loan shark's wife (Mariangela Melato) -- and the next garment he dons might be a cement overcoat. In his first outing in the director's chair, writer Andrew Bergman (The In-Laws, Fletch) has designed the latest fashion in funny business. So Fine wears well and all comedy movies should have such a terrific fit.

Directed By Andrew Bergman
Starring Ryan O'Neal, Jack Warden, Mariangela Melato

Music composed by Philippe Sarde

Tribute trailer edited by Gianfranco Firriolo

Film review from IMDb:
Spectacularly sleazy, beautiful, boisterous and sexy, this is the real Bukowski deal, a booze-fueled erotic odyssey by the adventurous Ferreri with the perfectly cast Ben Gazzara as Charles Serking (Bukowski).
Ornella Muti, as Serking's sexual muse, is Venus incarnate and turns in a powerhouse performance as Cass, an emotionally damaged whore with a penchant for pain. The scenes of Gazzara swaggering in and out of LA's fleapit bars, apartments and hotel rooms convey a filthy, delirious ambiance that is vividly captured by Tonino Delli Colli's superb cinematography and Dante Ferretti's exquisitely oily production design. This is such an amazing looking film with a thick, steamy, anything-goes atmosphere of lust-ridden anarchy.
Much grittier than the accomplished ""Barfly"" and more watchable than ""Love Is A Dog From Hell"", the entire affair has an emotional, raw resonance that slavishly captures the Bukowski sensibility and remains consistently perverse in its singular vision of a man enslaved by alcoholic and sexual gluttony.
Phillipe Sarde's score is moody and rich, as is Gazzara's breathy voice-over.
A masterpiece.",74466,120,4,PT1M29S,0

The original movie is almost intense and brutal as the recent remake! So definitely worth getting this DVD! 
An aspiring writer is repeatedly gang-raped, humiliated, and left for dead by four men whom she systematically hunts down to seek revenge.

Some Trivia
=========
- There is a hidden easter egg on the Special Edition version [UK.] On page three of the special features, go to 'main menu' then hit left, and you can highlight the knife that Jennifer holds. The easter egg reveals a selection of stills from the movie.

- The poster's tagline mistakenly says, ""This woman has just cut, chopped, broken and burned five men beyond recognition."" There are only four men she gets revenge on and she does not burn any of them. In the remake I Spit on Your Grave, a fifth man is added.

- Director Meir Zarchi prefers the title ""Day of the Woman"".

- Actor Richard Pace (Matthew) unintentionally worried director Meir Zarchi filming his death scene when he started to convulse while hanging. Zarchi initially thought he was just doing some really good acting, but realized that something was wrong. Pace wasn't choking, but was afraid of heights and was having a panic attack.

From director Spike Jonze and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the team responsible for the hilarious BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, comes ADAPTATION - a wildly unpredictable comedy about a writer who, out of sheer desperation, decides to insert himself into the screenplay he's struggling to adapt. It's a great idea, until reality and fiction begin to overlap in the most unexpected ways.

Cannery Row Trailer - Directed by David S. Ward and starring Nick Nolte, Frank McRae, M. Emmet Walsh, Tom Mahoney, John Malloy. A depressed section of Monterey, California is the backdrop for an offbeat romantic comedy about a pair of mismatched lovers. Doc is a lonely marine biologist and former baseball star. Suzy is a scrappy, abrasive drifter who can't even succeed as a prostitute. Add Cannery Row's band of resident drunken derelicts to the mix and fireworks result, though not the romantic kind.

I hope you enjoy my custom trailer for Robert Altman's ""Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"". The film itself is out-of-print and has never been officially released on DVD (although there are VHS and Laserdisc copies around, as well as on Bootleg DVD). Perhaps someday it will once again see the light of day in an official video format.

Movie Description
With COME BACK TO THE 5 & DIME JIMMY DEAN, JIMMY DEAN, Robert Altman began to turn to theatrical plays as source material for his films, with the filmed plays STREAMERS and SECRET HONOR following in the wake of ...JIMMY DEAN by playwright Ed Graczyk. The film concerns a group of women who reunite in their hometown of McCarthy, Texas in 1975 to hold a twenty-year reunion of their James Dean fan club. In 1955, they were an excited group of high school graduates who eagerly anticipated their hero's arrival in a nearby town to film GIANT. As the story unfolds, the friends--Mona (Sandy Dennis), Sissy (Cher), Stella Mae (Kathy Bates), Edna Louise (Marta Heflin), and Juanita (Sudie Bond) reminisce fondly about the past, but when a mysterious woman arrives (Karen Black), a series of shocking revelations threatens to ruin the reunion. The actresses imbue their characters with a tragic honesty that makes their eventual confessions all the more heartbreaking and poignant (notably, Dennis's troubled Mona). Altman, who directed the play both on and off Broadway before deciding to film it, employs visual dissolves, and mirrors to add a cinematic layering to the production. The result is a powerful, sobering portrait of a group of women who allowed deception to take control of their lives.

Synopsis
A group of women friends--members of the James Dean fan club they formed in 1955 in McCarthy, Texas--hold their 20-year reunion at a ""5 & Dime"" drugstore. The different directions their lives have taken--and the varying degrees of success they have met with--creates numerous striking, insightful, and sometimes painful contrasts.

Film Notes
Robert Altman directed eighty performances of the play on and off Broadway before making the film.

The production was shot in super-16mm with a budget of $850,000 -- which is not a typical film format or budget for other than a low-budget independent feature film. Most cost considerably more and are shot in the industry standard of 35mm.",43045,189,42,PT2M56S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Prince Andrei (Mel Ferrer) expresses his interest in Natasha (Audrey Hepburn) at a formal dance.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
War and Peace is a commendable attempt to boil down Tolstoy's long, difficult novel into 208 minutes' screen time. In recreating the the social and personal upheavals attending Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia, $6 million was shelled out by coproducers Carlo Ponti, Dino de Laurentiis and Paramount Pictures. Some of the panoramic battle sequences are so expertly handled by second-unit director Mario Soldati that they appear to be Technicolor-and-Vistavision newsreel footage of the actual events. Still, the film falters dramatically, principally because of a lumpy script and King Vidor's surprisingly lustreless direction. In addition, the casting is wildly consistent: for example, while Audrey Hepburn is flawless as Natasha, Henry Fonda is far too ""Yankeefied"" as the introspective Pierre. Proving too long and unwieldy for most audiences, War and Peace died at the box office; far more successful was the epic, scrupulously faithful 1968 version, filmed in the Soviet Union.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Pinocchio (Roberto Benigni) becomes a real boy and runs around Geppetto

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Academy Award-winner Roberto Benigni adapts the classic children's tale by Carlo Collodi for the big-budget family-oriented comedy Pinocchio. In his usual fashion, Benigni directs and stars, this time as the little puppet boy made out of wood. The familiar story begins as a log of pinewood falls out of a cart and lands in front of woodcarver, Geppetto (Carlo Giuffré), who carves the puppet out of longing for a son. When the puppet begins to come alive and cause trouble, Geppetto is arrested and Pinocchio is left to his own naïve worldview. After getting a stern warning from the Blue Fairy (Benigni's wife and producer Nicoletta Braschi), Pinocchio sets out to reunite with his father, become a real boy, and succumb to some desire for adventure. Along the way, he meets a number of characters played by mostly Italian stage actors, including Franco Javarone, Peppe Barra, and Kim Rossi Stuart. The popular Italian comedy team Fichi d'India plays the roles of the Cat and Fox. Released by Miramax in the U.S., the film received an English-dubbed soundtrack with the voice talents of Glenn Close, David Suchet, and Breckin Meyer as Pinocchio.

3876,oBJ4fiiFVM0,Wim Wenders on Dennis Hopper and THE AMERICAN FRIEND,"For the lead role of Tom Ripley in Wim Wenders’s THE AMERICAN FRIEND, a melancholy neonoir that fused Wenders’s New German sensibility with classic Hollywood drama, the director needed an actor who could convey menace with complexity. Wenders had his eye on John Cassavetes for the role, hoping his emotional intelligence and filmmaker’s insight would provide another layer to the soul of Ripley. Cassavetes turned down the offer but recommended fellow actor-director Dennis Hopper, and Wenders soon came to realize that Hopper’s eccentric persona embodied the mysterious, ominous quality he was after. (Wenders went on to fill the rest of the film’s roster of crooks and gangsters with other legendary directors—the American titans Samuel Fuller and Nicholas Ray and the French New Wave hero Jean Eustache.) In this video, Wenders discusses how Hopper’s idiosyncratic interpretation of Ripley brought the character to life.",31133,454,23,PT52S,0

In the 1800's there was a woman that little children would take their old teeth (ones they had recently lost) to in exchange for a gold coin. A few years later, tragedy struck her, first a fire in her house which caused her to not be able to go into any type of light, and then she was hanged. There's a story that goes around the town of Darkness Falls about her, and she's called the Tooth Fairy. The story goes that she can't go in the light, and if you wake up and see her, she'll kill you. The usual saying is ""Don't Peek."" Well, there is a boy named Kyle who gets a warning from his friend Caitlin to not peek. Well, he wakes up on the night when the Tooth Fairy is supposed to come and get his last tooth and sees her. It all leads to more tragedy and the movie jumps to 12 years later. Now grown up, Caitlin calls Kyle because her little brother Michael is going through the same things he did as a boy, and wants his help. Kyle goes back to Darkness Falls to face his past, and the woman in the porcelain mask (aka the Tooth Fairy).

3888,IaG672NAfj4,2002 AMEN TRAILER,"Trailer from the 2002 French movie AMEN.

A little background:

In 1942 Kurt Gerstein was an and SS-Untersturmführer in charge of Heinrich Himmler's Technical Disinfection Department of the Waffen-SS.  In June of 1942 Gerstein was ordered by SS-Sturmbannführer Rolf Günther of the Reich Security Main Office to deliver 220 pounds of Zyklon-B to an unknown destination.

On August 19, 1942 Gerstein arrived at Belzec concentration camp in Poland where he witnessed the gassing of 6700 Jews. As a Protestant Gerstein was shocked by what he had witnessed at the three camps he eventually inspected (Majdanek, Belzec, and Treblinka).

It is said that after witnessing these gassings at Belzec, Gerstein buried the Zyklon-B canisters that he was detailed to deliver to the extermination camps.

Gerstein later met Swedish diplomat Baron Göran von Otter and told all. Von Otter made a detailed report of his conversation with the SS officer and sent it to his superiors. They did nothing. Gerstein later attempted to contact the Legation of the Holy See but was denied access as he was a soldier. Gerstein continued to inform religious and diplomatic officials about the details and magnitude of the atrocities taking place in Poland. Very few listened.

Amen. is a French film about Kurt Gerstein's attempt to expose the Holocaust to world  through Pope Pius XII and the Vatican. 

In July 1945 Gerstein was foumnd haning in his French prison cell from makeshift noose. It is commonly thought that Gerstein commited suicide but it is possible that he was murdered by fellow SS officers in an attempt to cover up their crimes.

I have posted this trailer as I am sick of the anti-Jewish and anti-German remarks made by neo-Nazis and Holocaust 'revionists',  who deny the greatest known mass murder of all time on pathetic racist and anti-Semitic grounds.

3901,DwytTsUy0kg,May (2002) - Official DVD Trailer,"---- My First YouTube Video! ---- 
► Official DVD trailer for 2002 horror movie ""May"". Directed by Lucky McKee. Cast: Angela Bettis, Jeremy Sisto, Anna Faris, and others.

● Plot: As a child, May (Angela Bettis) had a lazy eye and had to wear a patch, which kept other children from befriending her. Her mother gave her a handmade doll, which became her only companion. Now, as a young adult, the doll is still May's only friend. But when she meets Adam (Jeremy Sisto) at a coffee shop and feels a strong attraction toward him, she tries to overcome her shyness and pursue him. When he ends their very brief relationship, however, it cements May's belief that no person is entirely good--only PARTS of them are good--and she decides to put that concept into frightening practice. A bizarre, darkly comic, and bloody horror treat, MAY is a strikingly original directorial debut from Lucky McKee.

After the two fall in love, their relationship is threatened as both vie for a spot on the U. S. Olympic team.

Personal Best's human insights make it compelling for more than just sports fans. Months of training build into explosive moments of competitive truth. Cameras capture the charged atmosphere of the 1980 Olympic Trials. And world-class athletes (including Olympians Donnelly, Jodi Anderson and Kenny Moore) excel as actors, bringing to the set the same poise they show on the track. #Trailer #WB",39765,60,15,PT2M8S,0

3940,0K8j3MU9dw4,Sans Soleil - Chris Marker (trailer 30th anniversary),"Stretching the genre of documentary, this experimental essay-film is a composition of thoughts, images and scenes, mainly from Japan and Guinea-Bissau, ""two extreme poles of survival"".[1] Some other scenes were filmed in Iceland, Paris, and San Francisco. A female narrator reads from letters supposedly sent to her by the (fictitious) cameraman Sandor Krasna.
Sans Soleil is often labeled as a documentary, travelogue, or essay-film. Despite the film's modest use of fictional content, it should not be confused as a mock-documentary; the fictitious content works as a device to assist meaning in the film which, along with its occasionally nondescript movement among locations and lack of character-based narrative, is derived from the juxtaposition of narrative and image.

Le film est construit autour du discours d'un cameraman fictif, Sandor Krasna, rédacteur de lettres lues tout au long du film par Florence Delay. Dans ses écrits, il va traiter successivement du temps, de la mémoire, de la fragilité humaine face aux séismes du Japon ou encore face à la famine, menace constante au Cap Vert ou en Guinée-Bissau. Le cinéaste voyage alors aux « deux pôles extrêmes de la survie » tel qu'il le dit lui-même. Il montrera non pas les difficultés pour ces sociétés à s'en sortir, mais plutôt leur façon de vivre et d'exister au-delà de ce qui peut leur coûter la vie.

Surprised at having Savannah in the car, the criminals try to decide what to do with her.  Savannah refuses to tell them her name or where she lives.  So, they have no choice but to take her back to their hideout. Savannah's disappearance is in the newspapers and a $100,000 reward is offered for her safe return.  The criminals decide to keep her a little longer so they can figure out how to collect the money and not be caught or charged with kidnapping. A unique friend ship emerges as the three get to know each other as a hard-nosed detective (Peter Graves) tries to find her.

One-man crusader and irrepressible seeker of justice Charles Bronson (The Great Escape) steps into the shoes of seasoned LA vice cop Lieutenant Crowe in Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects, an action-packed revenge thriller from veteran genre director J. Lee Thompson (Death Wish 4).

I know; it's pretty ludicrous that I haven't seen these timeless classics.  If Richard Fleischer's Mr. Majestyk is any indication of Bronson's existing canon, I can safely say that I am altogether hooked.  Bronson truly deserves his iconic status as an action hero.

Four unnamed people who look and sound a lot like Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, and Joseph McCarthy converge in one New York City hotel room for this compelling, visually inventive adaptation of Terry Johnson's play, from director Nicolas Roeg. With a combination of whimsy and dread, Roeg creates a fun-house-mirror picture of cold war America that questions the nature of celebrity and plays on a society's simmering nuclear fears. Insignificance is a delirious, intelligent drama, featuring magnetic performances by Michael Emil as ""the professor,"" Theresa Russell as ""the actress,"" Gary Busey as ""the ballplayer,"" and Tony Curtis as ""the senator.""",74789,271,22,PT1M18S,0

Zaza is a 31-year old Israeli bachelor, handsome and intelligent, and his family wants to see him married. But tradition dictates that Zaza has to choose a young virgin. She must be beautiful and from a good family, preferably rich. Zaza's parents, Yasha and Lily drag Zaza to meet potential brides and their families. Zaza has no choice. He plays along with his family, advocates of the suffocating traditions of their Georgian Jewish heritage. But Zaza always manages to somehow get out of being engaged. What his parents don't know is that Zaza is already in love. Judith is sensuous, strong and intriguing. She's also a divorcée with a 6-year-old daughter. So Zaza has kept Judith a secret from his family. He will have to choose between respect of the strict confines of family and tradition, or the love of his life.

Sean Vetter and his partner Demetrius Hicks came up on the mean streets of Los Angeles but now work together as DEA agents, fighting a seven-year war to stem the virulent drug pipeline along the US/Mexico border. Dubbed ""the gunslingers"" for their tough street tactics, their perseverance pays off when they take down notorious Baja Cartel kingpin Memo Lucero Geno.With Lucero locked away in a maximum security prison, Vetter is finally able to go home to his wife, Stacy, a sanctuary from the harsh realities of his job. But in the wake of Lucero's arrest, a mysterious figure, known only as Diablo, emerges to violently claim the Baja Cartel. And when Vetter and Hicks set their sights on identifying and stopping this dangerous and elusive new player, Diablo makes the fight personal--robbing Vetter of the one person who gives his life meaning--Stacy. With nothing to lose, Vetter pulls out every hidden resource at his disposal to bring Diablo down--including an unlikely alliance with the jailed Cartel boss Lucero. He will stop at nothing to avenge his wife's murder, edging dangerously close to the line between justice and lawlessness, even if it sets him at odds with the police unit to which he has dedicated his life.

When two college students, Sam and Thea, meet Coles at a party, their mutual attraction is immediate, leading to a passionate and awkward night together, and the onset of an intensely charged bond.

Eight years later they reunite. An animator for a high-profile ad agency, Coles now lives with Claire, his girlfriend of five years. Thea is happily married to Miles, with whom she owns a flourishing restaurant. And Sam has just returned to Manhattan after working in London where she recently broke off her engagement.

Though Wise’s film was advertised as a wall-to-wall nail-biter (“The suspense will last a lifetime!”) the movie is largely inert with a buttoned-down cast (including Arthur Hill and David Wayne) that only adds to the general lethargy. The comparatively mild scenes of violence and nudity caused some to question the film’s “G” rating in 1971.

Then he meets Yolanda--his daughter's soulfully beautiful ballet teacher--a woman who sparks his long-forgotten passions and represents all that is good and all that is corrupt in their troubled country.

His boss trusts him, but what he doesn't know is Mahowny is a compulsive gambler. And soon he's skimming larger and larger amounts for his own use and making weekly trips to Atlantic City, where he's treated more like a king by a greedy casino manager (Hurt) with every additional thousand he lays down on the table. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, fellow bank employee Belinda (Driver), can't understand what's happening, and the wheels go into motion at the bank when the first missing amount is uncovered.
The movie's focus is on Mahowny as a character—how his compulsion drives him and all the domino effects it has on the rest of his life. The love story between Mahowny and Belinda and the inclusion of other finely drawn characters such as hapless casino employee Bernie (Chris Collins) put the emphasis squarely on the gambling addiction, not on the flash and sizzle of big casinos or multi-million-dollar frauds.",21502,61,3,PT2M2S,0

In fact, it's virtually identical to the first Breakin', only with a sillier plot and crazier dance sequences.  It also retains its predecessor's sense of pure glee, preventing the movie from feeling like the crass cash-in it actually is.

4076,atBdy_7hoWo,THE CARPETBAGGERS (Trailer),"Here's the trailer for THE CARPETBAGGERS (1964). The film is such an outrageous mix of Hollywood melodrama, pop psychology and salacious sleaze that it's fun in a gruesome sort of way. It's an adaptation of a novel by Harold Robbins, which is one of the best-selling novels of all time, and the movie was also a huge hit (even though it's much less explicit ;-)). The characters are based on famous movie people of the '30s (eg Howard Hughes, Jean Harlow, Tom Mix and Joan Crawford).

What I like best about the movie (and the trailer) is the main title theme by Elmer Bernstein.

This was Alan Ladd's last movie. As a fan of his, I find his later movies very painful to watch, due to his tragically premature demise. Still, his performance in this one is pretty good. It makes one think that he could have become a competent character actor, rather than a slowly fading leading man, if depression and alcohol hadn't ruined him. There's a bit of dialogue in this film that I find very poignant:

Ladd: I just try to act out people's dreams.
Baker: Do you like it?
Ladd: Yes I do. It's fun.

AL often could make even the most clichéd lines sound credible and cool, but I never believed him less than when he says ""It's fun.""

4078,9Gk8pZpuZEU,John Landis on KISS ME KATE,"George Sidney's terrific film adaptation of the popular Broadway musical (derived from Taming of the Shrew) underwent a lot of cleaning up from the Hays Office, which removed numerous suggestive lyrics and risque jokes. Even so, it's considered one of the most entertaining of the vaunted MGM musicals and still enchants today. Although the cleverly shot 3-D version initially racked up stronger grosses, the film played the majority of its major dates, including Radio City Music Hall, in 2D.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Vin Diesel opted to not appear in the sequel to the film the shot him to stardom in the first place, The Fast and the Furious. With the character of Dominic Toretto out of the picture, 2 Fast 2 Furious concentrates exclusively on the latest exploits of undercover agent Brian O'Connor, played by Paul Walker. In addition, with director Rob Cohen passing, producers have added a dash of credibility to the sequel by hiring John Singleton to helm. What does completely remain from the first film is the presence of fast-living underground street-racing gangs. Moving from Los Angeles to Miami, O'Connor is looking to redeem himself after the events of the first movie, so he again goes undercover to infiltrate another group of thuggish car enthusiasts. This time around he's enlisted the help of ex-con Roman Pierce (Tyrese) and fellow agent Monica Celemente (Eva Mendes) to bring down Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), an importer/exporter who heads up a massive drug trafficking operation. Heading up the supporting cast are hip-hop stars Ludacris and Fabolous.

Funny encounters occur at an all African-American car wash.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Michael Schultz directed this kinetic, hyperventilating comedy (scripted by Joel Schumacher) concerning the crazed events that go on within a single 10-hour period at a Los Angeles car wash. The cast of colorful car-wash employees includes Lonnie (Ivan Dixon), an ex-con; Duane (Bill Duke), a militant black activist; and Lindy (Antonio Fargas), an obnoxious homosexual. Sully Boyar plays Mr. B, the frazzled car-wash owner who has to deal with his screwball employees along with his over-educated slip of a son, Irwin (Richard Brestoff), who quotes Mao and wants to radicalize the workers. Also along for the wash and wax are Miss Beverly Hills (Lauren Jones), with a wild assortment of wigs; Marsha (Melanie Mayron), the distracted car wash secretary; a mad bomber (Prof. Irwin Corey), who is terrorizing the neighborhood; and Daddy Rich (Richard Pryor), the founder of the Church of Divine Economic Spirituality, who sports a gold limousine. Danny de Vito, Brooke Adams and others were originally in the cast but their scenes were ultimately deleted.

4161,RA3Yw7NxKcY,HD TRAILER: Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle,"The Angels, Dylan, Natalie, and Alex, are hired to locate a set of titanium rings stolen from the Department of Justice that, when put together in a special machine, will display a list of all individuals in the witness protection program. Having discovered that one person on the list has been killed, the Angels investigate the scene and discover evidence suggesting that the killer is a surfer with a scar on one leg. Having tracked the killer to his next victim - who is subsequently sent to Bosley's house for protection - it is revealed that angel Dylan was once named Helen Zaas and is in the program herself for sending her former boyfriend Seamus - a member of the O'Grady mafia family - to jail.

Although they recover the rings, Dylan leaves the Angels because she doesn't want to endanger them with her Seamus's vendetta, but a vision of former Angel Kelly Garrett prompts her to return. Dylan and the others deduce that former angel Madison Lee is the perpetrator of the crimes due to her being the only individual possessing the necessary contacts to carry out such a scheme. Madison, having concluded ""Why be an Angel, when [she] can be God"", having shot the Angels after reacquiring the rings, although they are saved by their specially-designed Kevlar vests - returns to the agency to ""confront"" Charlie, rejecting his attempts to remind her that the Angels are a family and shooting his speaker off the desk, coldly sneering that she was always the best.

Learning that the rings will be sold after a rendezvous on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Angels travel to Hollywood. They set the Antonioni Crime Family, the Tanaka Yakuza, and the Diablo Cartel up to be caught by the FBI in a faked rendezvous. With Madison having contacted the O'Gradys to act as security, Alex and Dylan take out the O'Gradys, while Natalie and Madison go head-to-head themselves. Seamus kills the Creepy Thin Man as he shares a kiss with Dylan and Dylan manages to kill her ex, with the Angels subsequently stopping Madison's attempt to blow up the premiere of Alex's boyfriend Jason's new movie thanks to Bosley knocking the bomb away. Although Madison tries to escape, the Angels defeat her in a final confrontation in an abandoned theatre, throwing her through a gas main just as she fires her gun, causing an explosion that kills her. The film ends with the Angels celebrating their victory with Bosley.",74534,48,5,PT35S,0

Gene Wilder and Donald Sutherland star as a pair of mixed up and mismatched twins, one peasant, one aristocrat, in this slapstick, satirical historical farce. From the acclaimed comedy team of Bud Yorkin and Norman Lear, this parody of French Revolution sagas like Dicken's A Tale of Two Cities and Dumas' The Corsican Brothers is an often overlooked gem that sparked a revolution in film comedy. ""France. 1789."" awaits. Get started.

4175,aaVN_HVO9Qo,Up The Sandbox  /1972/ trailer,"A young wife and mother, bored with day-to-day life in New York City and neglected by her husband, slips into increasingly outrageous fantasies: her mother breaking into the apartment, an explorer's demonstration of tribal fertility music at a party causing strange transformations, and joining terrorists to plant explosives in the Statue of Liberty.
Critics in general were impressed by Streisand's performance but thought the film itself was a confusing mess. 
Audiences just weren't ready for this kind of storytelling in 1972 yet . 20 years later in Ally McBeal it was just right time!
This movie about family issues and famiy values can be considered as a predecessor of  Krammer vs. Krammer in a way.  It is also a great study of the role of woman in the society and role of mother in the family.

As befits the brief post Easy Rider era when directors were as famous as stars, this is an unusually auteur-centered trailer.

A beautiful new restoration of Pasolini's masterpiece in which Christ is portrayed as a peasant outcast fuelled by social injustice. The use of music - from Bach to Billie Holiday - is highly inventive and profoundly moving.

4217,vDQo4Nld6ho,Larry Karaszewski on DAY OF THE DOLPHIN,"1973’s The Day of the Dolphin was based on a French sci-fi thriller about talking dolphins involved in a plot to assassinate the president. Its Greenpeace Meets James Bond storyline managed to attract directors as disparate as Roman Polanski and Franklin Schaffner but the task eventually fell to Mike Nichols who enlisted his Graduate scribe Buck Henry to tap out the screenplay. Starring George C. Scott as a kind of water-logged Dr. Doolittle, Nichols described the Bahamas-set shoot as his “toughest” ever. Georges Delerue’s achingly lovely score was nominated for an Academy Award.

When a hopeful young American hot-dogger goes pole-to-pole with an arrogant Austrian pro, the snow really starts to fly! But as hot as it is on the mountain, it gets even hotter off when the pro's ex-girlfriend (Tweed) sets her eyes on the new blood. Who'll win the competition and the girl?

Wait Until Dark (1967) is a suspense thriller starring Audrey Hepburn and directed by Terence Young.

In 1966 Warner Bros.-Seven Arts purchased the rights to Frederick Knott's play and in 1967 made the famous film adaptation. The script was written by Robert Howard-Carrington and directed by Terence Young. It starred Audrey Hepburn, Alan Arkin, Richard Crenna, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., and Jack Weston.

In an effort to duplicate the suspense on screen, movie theaters dimmed their lights to their legal limits, then turned off one by one until each light on-screen was shattered, resulting in the theater being plunged into complete darkness.

Hepburn was nominated for both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Actress, and Zimbalist was nominated for a Globe in the supporting category.

The film ranked tenth on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments for its riveting climax. In 2001 the film was also ranked #55 on AFI's 100 Years 100 Thrills.

A 1982 HBO television movie starred Katharine Ross and Stacy Keach.

줄거리 : 서울의 정동극장, 무대에 명창 조상현이 올라오고 ‘춘향전’ 공연이 시작된다. 조상현의 소리에 맞춰 화면은 조선 시대의 한 관아로 바뀐다. 단오절, 남원부 자제 이몽룡(조승우)는 방자(김학용)를 앞세워 광한루 구경을 나서고, 그곳에서 그네를 타고 있는 춘향(이효정)을 만난다. 그날 이후 춘향을 보고 싶은 몽룡은 야심한 밤, 춘향의 집을 방문한다. 몽룡은 춘향 어미 월매(김성녀) 앞에서 춘향에게 ‘불망기’를 써 사랑을 맹세한다. 첫날밤을 보낸 후 둘의 사랑은 더욱 깊어가지만 몽룡은 동부승지 당상하여 한양에 가게 된 아버지를 따라 남원을 떠나야 하고, 몽룡과 춘향은 서로의 거울과 가락지를 나눈 후 이별한다. 새로 부임한 변 사또(이정헌)는 남원골 절색 춘향에게 수청 들기를 강요한다. 춘향은 수청을 거부하고, 변 사또는 춘향에게 모진 고문을 가하고 옥에 가둔다. 한편 한양에서 장원급제한 몽룡은 암행어사로 다시 전라도로 온다. 변학도의 폭정과 춘향의 고초를 알게 된 몽룡은 그날 밤 거지 행색으로 월매와 옥에 갖힌 춘향을 찾는다. 변학도의 생일날, 성대한 잔치가 벌어지는 틈에 암행어사 출두가 붙여지고, 몽룡은 변학도를 비롯한 부패한 탐관오리들을 응징한다. 춘향은 풀려나고, 월매와 동네 사람들은 기쁨의 노래를 부른다. 화면이 다시 공연장으로 돌아오면, 조상현의 소리와 함께 추임새를 넣는 관객들의 소리가 어우러진다.

Originally from Indiana, Alig moved to New York, and came to be an underground legend, known for his excessive drug use and outrageous behavior in the club world. At his peak, he had his own record label, and magazine, and hosted Disco 2000, one of the biggest club nights in New York in the '90s. He was doing a lot of drugs, and as his addiction got worse, his party themes became darker and more twisted. Alig's saga reached its tragic crescendo when he viciously murdered his drug dealer, Angel, by injecting him with Drano and throwing him in the East River. The power he wielded on the club scene made him feel untouchable, so he didn't hestitate to boast of the murder.

And although Billy doesn't want Jackson, two other guys do: Derek, a clean-cut record store customer, and Sam, the straight record store owner. Into this mix is thrown Jed, Jackson's hunky cousin, which leads Jackson to seriously contemplate the technicalities of incest.

Need more drama in your life? Check out http://www.youtube.com/c/Paramountvault

Continuing his 1970s recreations of classical Hollywood genres and styles, Peter Bogdanovich turned to the literary costume drama with an adaptation of the Henry James novella Daisy Miller. At a Swiss spa, upper-class expatriate American Frederick Winterbourne (Barry Brown) meets pretty, nouveau riche flirt Daisy Miller (Cybill Shepherd); her bratty, xenophobic little brother Randolph (James McMurtry); and her tremulous, nattering mother (Cloris Leachman). Despite warnings from his dowager aunt (Mildred Natwick) about Daisy's recklessness with men, Winterbourne finds himself drawn to her. When he encounters her again in Rome, he tries to convince her that her liberated behavior with an Italian admirer (Duilio Del Prete) may sully her reputation in aristocratic circles. But Winterbourne cannot reconcile his own feelings for Daisy with the manners that he is used to following, nor can he fathom how she may feel about him beneath her veneer of willful coquetry. After society matron Mrs. Walker (Eileen Brennan) ostracizes her, Daisy's final rash action reveals to Winterbourne how his old-fashioned mores may have sealed her fate. With a screenplay by Frederic Raphael and location shooting in Rome and Switzerland, Bogdanovich carefully recreated the rich surroundings and stultifying social strictures of James' story. Despite this well-executed atmosphere, Daisy Miller suffered critically, as Bogdanovich was especially taken to task for casting the amateurish Shepherd in the complex and pivotal role of Daisy. After three consecutive hits with The Last Picture Show (1971), What's Up, Doc? (1972), and Paper Moon (1973), Daisy Miller flopped, beginning Bogdanovich's mid-'70s slide into box-office and critical ignominy.",36632,117,26,PT1H31M25S,0

Thank you.

Jet Li is back as irrepressible folk-hero and martial arts master Wong Fei-hung in the No 1 Hong Kong Box Office smash-hit ""Once upon a time in China 2"".

Featuring a tense, atmospheric story which centres on Canton and the destructive power struggle between the official government, the emerging democracy movement and the rabidly xenophobic White Lotus Cult, this movie entered the record books as the 100th movie to depict the life of legendary hero Wong Fei-hung, making the series the longest running in movie-making history.

This movie has everything which made its predecessor such a success; a dynamic, incorruptible hero brought brilliantly to life by Jet Li, a supremely talented supporting cast, beautifully conceived sets, stylish cinematography and breath-taking fight sequences.

Highlight: Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen.

4317,iLhlQiQcSk0,Yossi & Jagger (2002) - Movie Trailer,"Yossi (Ohad Knoller) is the stoic company commander of an Israeli Defense Forces unit on the Lebanese border. Jagger (Yehuda Levi), who got his nickname thanks to his fun-loving rock star appeal, is the platoon leader. They have a secret. When they walk off in the snow together, it isn't because they're on patrol--it's because they're lovers. Jagger is more gregarious. He tells Yossi that he loves him, and longs to hear Yossi say it back to him. He makes plans for their future together, urging Yossi to leave the army with him when Jagger's mandatory service is done. Yossi can't bring himself to make any promises. ""This isn't some. . .American movie,"" he tells Jagger. The colonel (Sharon Reginiano) arrives with two female soldiers, the irrepressible sexpot Goldie (Hani Furstenberg) and her more introspective friend Yaeli (Aya Koren of Late Marriage), who harbors a serious crush on Jagger, and is herself pursued by Jagger's nosy roommate, Ofir (Assi Cohen). As the unit's perfectionist chef, Yaniv (Erez Kahana) struggles to make a sumptuous meal for the commanding officer with meager supplies, the colonel tells Yossi that Hezbollah forces are expected to cross the border, and the already exhausted unit needs to set up an ambush that night. Yossi & Jagger, directed by Eytan Fox, was a critical and commercial hit in Israel. It was shown at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival and had its U.S. premiere at the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival.

Not traditional is that Angelo decides to move out of the house before he's married, even though he's twenty-seven years old. But getting married is not in the cards for Angelo as he's gay but still deeply in the closet at least to himself and his unsuspecting family. Once out on his own, Angelo runs into his only childhood friend, Nino Paventi. Always a man's type of man, Nino is now a macho police officer. But Nino is also gay and deeply in the closet. Angelo and Nino rekindle their friendship and start a romance. Nino ends up moving in with Angelo, a difficult move since Nino also comes from a traditional ethnic Italian family. Together at home, they live in coupled bliss, but outside of the house they retain their separate straight acting lives. Angelo decides that he finally wants to come out to his family so that they will really know who he is before they die. This decision does not sit well with Nino as he is not ready to tell the world he's gay. Angelo's decision has a profound effect on himself, on Nino, their relationship and their respective relationships with their families.

BOYZ N THE HOOD is the critically acclaimed story of three friends growing up in a South Central Los Angeles neighborhood, and of street life where friendship, pain, danger and love combine to form reality. ""The Hood"" is a place where drive-by shootings and unemployment are rampant. But it is also a place where harmony coexists with adversity, especially for three young men growing up there: Doughboy (Ice Cube), an unambitious drug dealer; his brother Ricky (Morris Chestnut), a college-bound teenage father; and Ricky's best friend Tre (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who aspires to a brighter future beyond ""The Hood"". In a world where a trip to the store can end in death, the friends have diverse reactions to their bleak surroundings. Tre's resolve is strengthened by a strong father (Larry Fishburne) who keeps him on the right track. But the lessons Tre learns are put to the ultimate test when tragedy strikes close to home, and violence seems like the only recourse.",124113,229,39,PT1M59S,0

4369,8Jc0P9AgqC0,The Amazing Transparent Man (trailer),"http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=AMAZINGT
The Amazing Transparent Man is a 1960 science fiction film starring Marguerite Chapman. Based on the 1956 novel The Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson, it is an American B-movie which follows the story of an insane ex U. S. Army major who uses an escaped criminal to steal materials to improve the invisibility machine his scientist prisoner made. It was one of two sci-fi films shot back to back by director Edgar G. Ulmer (the other being Beyond the Time Barrier). The combined filming schedule for both films was only two weeks. The film was later featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

The film has received very poor reviews and suffered in popularity as a result of its low budget. Leading science fiction author David Wingrove commented in his Science Fiction Source Book that ""Its cheap-budget origins show throughout. Amazing claims too much for what is essentially a thriller involving an escaped criminal...""

A group of doctors in a veteran's hospital must contend with their hopeless situation: too many patients and not enough beds.

For instance the actual first devil that dies.  If you seen the film you know who exactly dies first and the why and how as well.  So please don't flame me for changing the actual events.  This was done to avoid the graphic sexual nature of this movie.    Last thing I want is a flag or get banned from youtube.

Don't want to include music details because I don't want copyright hunters on my case.  Happened once with my Heroes/Watchmen video and it was banned.

THIS IS PURELY FAN MADE.  THIS VIDEO IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PIONEER NOR MANGA.  NO PROFIT IS BEING MADE FROM THIS PRODUCTION.

Fin McBride, a loner with a passion for trains, inherits an abandoned train station in the middle of nowhere -- a place that suits him just fine because all he wants is to be alone. But that is not to be. Soon after moving in, he discovers his isolated depot is more like Grand Central Station. There's Olivia, a distracted and troubled artist, and Joe, a friendly Cuban with an insatiable hunger for conversation. With absolutely nothing in common, they find their isolated lives coming together in a friendship none of them could foresee.

If time exists, can guilt -- like some illnesses -- be passed down from generation to generation? Can a sin that hasn't been expiated have an effect on the guilty party and his or her descendents? At the end of the World War II, and its concomitant settling of scores among collaborators, a woman was acquitted of a crime that she committed.
 The film takes place in the present day, during the last municipal elections when another crime will be committed. Who is guilty? The person who commits the crime or the person who takes the blame for it? And what if time didn't exist?

Roy Applewood's outrageous news shocks and angers Irma, his wife of 25 years. Despite his insistence that he wants the family to stay together, she kicks him out of the house.

Their adolescent daughter, Patty Ann, takes the news more in stride as she is discovering the awkwardness of her own burgeoning sexuality.

However, nothing in his career as a rock roadie has prepared the couple's grown son, Wayne, for dealing with his father's decision.

As Roy begins exploring the accoutrements of being a woman (from perfume to breasts) he faces ostracism within the community and ridicule on the job. But, he also finds compassion from unlikely sources, such as his boss, who is beginning to take an interest in Irma.

Ultimately, the family struggles to understand Roy's decision and he and Irma discover that love can transcend both the genders we're born with and the ones we choose.

4416,yVKdrnbmQlU,Man of Marble (Człowiek z marmuru) - Trailer,"Often described as the ‘Polish Citizen Kane’, Andrzej Wajda’s epic, “Man of Marble” (1976), made a strong political statement on the use of propaganda and the corruption of the Stalinist era while presaging the fall of the Soviets and the growth of the Solidarity Movement .

Mateusz Birkut, a bricklayer, glorified in a marble statue as a State-promoted ‘Worker’s Hero’ is subsequently removed from all official mention in 1952. Flash forward to the early 70s where young documentary filmmaker Agnieszka obsessively pursues her story. Birkut’s rise and fall and disappearance into obscurity provides Wajda with a framework for a brave reassessment of the period. Although suppressed by the authorities, Man of Marble is recognized as a milestone in Polish cinema.

The film has been restored from original materials, by Cyfrowe Repozytorium Filmowe (Digital Film Repository) as a part of the KinoRP Project.",22061,87,9,PT1M15S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) is a drunk who is also a mall Santa Claus. But mostly, he's a con man who robs department stores on Christmas Eve with the help of his little person elf, Marcus (Tony Cox). Willie befriends a strange kid (Brett Kelly) and gets caught up with Gin (Bernie Mac) who catches on to the con men's plan.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Christmas season just got a lot less joyous in this very dark comedy. Willie T. Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) is a con man and a thief who teams up with his friend Marcus (Tony Cox), a midget, for a very special scam each year during the holiday season. Willie gets a job as Santa Claus at a shopping mall, his pal tags along as an elf, and they use their employee status to crack mall security and rob stores blind just before Christmas. However, there's one flaw to this plan -- Willie is a bitter, foul-mouthed and perpetually grouchy alcoholic who doesn't care for kids, and it's all he can do to keep himself from getting fired while on the job. The mall's manager (John Ritter, in his last film appearance) is certain something's wrong with the Santa he's hired, so he asks the mall's chief of security (Bernie Mac) to do some research on Willie. Meanwhile, one of the kids Willie is forced to talk to becomes a regular customer; overweight, awkward, and the frequent target of bullies, the boy manages to arouse something like sympathy from Willie, who tries to give him some advice and develops something vaguely resembling Christmas sprit along the way. Bad Santa was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed previous success with Crumb and Ghost World.

Please visit my website at http://www.realmofhorror.co.uk

This film is a guilty pleasure of mine, which borrows heavily from the Richard Stanley film ""Hardware"" (both movies also feature actor William Hootkins).

I'd recommend this to all Brad fans and lovers of sci-fi/horror. However I would recommend getting the UK DVD, as this is much longer and uncut in terms of gore compared to the heavily truncated US disc, which is cut and misses out a lot of character development and sub plots.

There was also a much longer extended cut released on Japanese laserdisc (now long OOP), however this version simply contained extra dialogue, was slow paced and had no more action.

In short, go for the UK DVD as its the directors preffered cut.",134434,230,61,PT1M14S,0

Leopold Kessler, un joven americano va a trabajar en los ferrocarriles alemanes como revisor de coches-cama en Zentropa, una conocida empresa ferroviaria. Es su manera de mostrar un poco de amabilidad a un pueblo que ha sufrido tanto. Allí conoce las duras condiciones de vida de los alemanes de la posguerra y el amor en los brazos de Katharina, la hija del director de Zentropa. Sin embargo el ataque de los Werwolf (terroristas en favor del régimen nazista) y la cruda realidad harán que Leopold Kessler sucumba ante sus ideales.
Lars von Trier se basa en la historia de los Werwolf, grupos de guerrillas nazistas que llegaron a actuar incluso después del fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial (eso sí por poco tiempo), para contar esta historia, si bien es cierto que exagera la influencia y el poder que este grupo de guerrilleros tenía entonces.
Esta película constituye la última parte de la trilogía Europa, compuesta por El Elemento del Crimen y Epidemia, fue estrenada en Argentina y España y está disponible en castellano.

Slacker (1991) Trailer #1 - Richard Linklater Movie

Presents a day in the life in Austin, Texas among its social outcasts and misfits, predominantly the twenty-something set, using a series of linear vignettes. These characters, who in some manner just don't fit into the establishment norms, move seamlessly from one scene to the next, randomly coming and going into one another's lives. Highlights include a UFO buff who adamantly insists that the U.S. has been on the moon since the 1950s, a woman who produces a glass slide purportedly of Madonna's pap smear, and an old anarchist who sympathetically shares his philosophy of life with a robber.",294541,1691,131,PT2M45S,0

Dreyer's penultimate film is a heartrending hymn to the power of earthly passion and love. The intimate naturalism of the performances, the exquisite lighting, camera movements, sets and sounds all add to the sense of a super-reality, strangely familiar yet informed by mysterious forces of dark, almost primal emotion.

Incalculably influential, the film's nightmarishly jagged sets, sinister atmospheric and psychological emphasis left an immediate impact in its wake (horror, film noir, and gothic cinema would all be shaped directly by it). But this diabolical tale nevertheless stands alone - now more mesmerising than.

At the dawn of the new millennium, Japan is in a state of near-collapse. Unemployemnt is at an all-time high, and violence amongst the nation's youth is spiralling out of control. With school children boycotting their lessons and physically abusing their teachers, a beleagured and near-defeated government decides to introduce a radical new measure: the Battle Royale Act. Overseen by a former teacher, Kitano ('Beat' Takeshi), and requiring that a randomly chosen school class be taken to a deserted island and forced to fight each other to the death, the Act dictates that only one pupil be allowed to survive the punishment. He or she will return, not as the victor, but as the ultimate proof of the lengths to which the government are prepared to go to curb the tide of juvenile disobediance. Likened to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange by many critics, this explosive film shocked a nation with its violent portrayal of a society in ruins.",154788,276,38,PT1M39S,0

A diamond-hard heist thriller in the tradition of Entrapment and The Score, The Real McCoy explores the travails of  reformed cat burglar Karen McCoy (Academy Award® winner Kim Basinger, L.A Confidential), blackmailed into carrying out one final job.
 
When ex-con Karen McCoy attempts to turn her life around she finds she has very little leverage. With a son who believes she is dead, bullied by her parole officer and with no real job prospects, Karen is forced into a corner by ruthless crime boss Jack Lord (Terence Stamp, Wanted) who blackmails her into a seemingly impossible $18 million bank job.
 
Aided by well-meaning yet inexperienced crook J.T Barker (Val Kilmer, HEAT) Karen is tasked with one of the most dangerous assignments of her career, which will require not only perfect planning but every ounce of ingenuity,  technical wizardry and above all nerves of steel to execute.

4505,i7j_z3cWv9I,"National Velvet, Trailer (1944) Elizabeth Taylor, Mickey Rooney, Angela Lansbury","National Velvet is the story of a twelve-year old girl, Velvet Brown (Elizabeth Taylor), living in Sewels, in Sussex, England, who wins a spirited gelding in a raffle and trains it for the Grand National steeplechase, aided by her father's (Donald Crisp) hired hand, a young drifter, Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), who claims to have found Mrs. Brown's name and address among his deceased father's effects. Mi loathes horses, because while a jockey in Manchester, he caused a collision which resulted in the death of another jockey. The horse is called ""The Pie"", short for Pirate, the epithet given him by the previous owner due to his misbehavior. Velvet wins The Pie in a raffle and convinces Mi to train them both for the Grand National. The night before the race, Velvet senses that the Latvian jockey hired to ride The Pie doesn't believe he can win. Rather than give up the race, Mi imagines he will overcome his fears and ride in the Latvian's place. Velvet has other ideas, and in the end masquerades as the jockey herself and rides the horse to victory. Exhausted by the exertion of the five-mile race, Velvet collapses from the horse shortly after the finish, and is disqualified for not staying in the saddle until reaching the enclosure. A doctor discovers the fallen jockey is, in fact, ""an adolescent female"", and Velvet becomes a media sensation. Velvet declines offers of 5,000 pounds to travel to Hollywood with The Pie to be filmed, as ""he wouldn't like being looked at."" In the final scene of the film, Velvet rides off to reveal to a departing Mi that his father was Mrs. Brown's coach in her contest-winning swim across the English Channel as a young woman.
The film differs from the book in countless respects, from the colour of the horse and its name (in the book the horse is a piebald, named ""Piebald"") to the appearance of Velvet and her mother, both of whom have been glamourised into very different people. Velvet, in the book, is plain, pale and sickly; her mother weighs 16 stone. The Brown family has also been made to seem more educated and richer in the film version: Mr. Brown is a prosperous butcher while Mrs. Brown, who keeps the books, has won 100 pounds for swimming the English Channel.",50609,85,5,PT1M43S,0
4506,slszA6bi4LI,Darren Bousman on JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR,"Jesus Christ Superstar, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s rock opera about the final week in the life of Jesus, first appeared as a studio recording in 1970 before being given a fully-fledged production on Broadway in 1973. Norman Jewison’s film arrived soon after, allowing the show’s music to come full circle as it routinely appeared on top forty radio throughout the remainder of the decade. Jewison’s elegantly pragmatic approach to movie musicals (first seen in Fiddler on the Roof) served this production well, as did cinematographer Douglas Slocombe’s painterly evocation of the Mideast desert locales.

Defining the words 'art film' for a generation, Marienbad is every bit as extraordinary today as when it was premiered in Venice, 50 years ago this August.

The plot is banal and, as in Hiroshima, the characters have no names. X (Albertazzi) pursues A (Seyrig) through the endless corridors of a luxury hotel, trying to persuade her that they met last year, while M (Pitoëff), who may be A's husband, looks on. But, in the eternal present of Robbe-Grillet's screenplay, drenched in the organ score by Francis Seyrig (brother of Delphine), there can be no 'last year' (and probably no future either). Don't miss the chance to see this timeless masterpiece on the big screen, for which the inky blacks and flaring whites of Sacha Vierny's cinematography were made. There is, quite simply, no other movie like it.

Last Year in Marienbad was re-released by the BFI on 8 July 2011.

Blu-ray: http://www.newvideo.com/docurama/rivers-and-tides-blu-ray-edition/ 

In the timeless tradition of ""Winged Migration"" and ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" the theatrical phenomenon RIVERS AND TIDES depicts the magical relationship between art and nature while painting a visually intoxicating portrait of famed artist Andy Goldsworthy. Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited, the film follows the bohemian free spirit Goldsworthy all over the world as he demonstrates and opens up about his unique creative process. From his long-winding rock walls and icicle sculptures to his interlocking leaf chains and multicolored pools of flowers, Goldsworthy's painstakingly intricate masterpieces are made entirely of materials found in Mother Nature -- who threatens and often succeeds in destroying his art, sometimes before it is even finished.

With over ten four-star reviews from the nation's top critics, RIVERS AND TIDES serenely captures Goldsworthy in the midst of constructing his trademark ephemera on-camera creating a mesmerizing cinematic experience that helps us to appreciate nature in new and enchanting ways.",247767,858,26,PT1M54S,0

Katherine Ann Watson has accepted a position teaching art history at the prestigious Wellesley College. Watson is a very modern woman, particularly for the 1950s, and has a passion not only for art but for her students. For the most part, the students all seem to be biding their time, waiting to find the right man to marry. The students are all very bright and Watson feels they are not reaching their potential. Altough a strong bond is formed between teacher and student, Watson's views are incompatible with the dominant culture of the college.

4569,dXjjQPlctd0,Calendar Girls Official Trailer!,"Middle aged Chris Harper and Annie Clarke are best friends. They spend much of their time at their local Knapely, Yorkshire County chapter of the Women's Institute (WI), whose motto is ""enlightenment, fun and friendship"". Although they like most of the women at the WI (the friendship part), they, but the perceived flaky Chris in particular, hold the way Marie, the local president, runs the chapter with derision. They find much of what goes on there, especially the monthly presentations, banal and devoid of enlightenment and fun. Equally as banal was last year's fund-raising calendar, featuring local bridges, which raised a meager £75.60, with this year's proposed calendar, local churches, promising to be even more so. After Annie's husband John passes away from leukemia, Chris wants the WI to provide a memorial in his memory: a new sofa for the family room at the hospital. The one Chris wants to buy costs £999, which she proposes to raise by changing the fund-raising calendar to one featuring tasteful photographs of nude Knapely WI members. She got the idea by seeing all around her the notion of the old adage that sex sells. Annie likes the idea as it is analogous to one of horticultural-loving John's last statements about plants being the most glorious in the latter stages of their life, after which they quickly go to seed. To get the project off the ground, they not only have to convince nine other WI members to pose (December to be a group photograph), but they have to find a photographer they trust that will treat this task as an art project. Conversely, they aren't sure if they and the calendar will meet with the same contempt from Marie, the national WI organization and their friends and family that they are so trying to change in the Knapely WI, and in the process not only not raise the necessary money but in fact lose money instead. Publicity for the project in any form may have its own consequences, especially for Chris.",308717,520,26,PT2M31S,0

4615,N683gK0dMsM,The Boy With Green Hair Trailer,"Available on DVD from http://www.odeonent.co.uk

Peter Fry (Dean Stockwell) is a boy with no hair who refuses to speak to child psychologist Dr Evans (Robert Ryan) as to why he has been found lost and completely bald. But when the doctor shares his hamburger with him, Peter tells his incredible story expect doubting that the doctor will believe him. Peter a typical American boy, is orphaned when his parents are caught in the London Blitz. With no one wishing to tell him of his parents' fate, Peter is shuttled from one selfish relative to the next, ending with Gramp (Pat O'Brien) a kindly ex-vaudevillian. Peter learns from his teacher Miss Brand (Barbara Hale) that he is a war orphan and the very next morning his hair turns green! 
But other kids jeer at him; adults are perturbed, and even the kindly milkman turns against him. The absurd over-reactions of stupid people make his life a misery and drive him away. Shot just after the war, The Boy with Green Hair is Joseph Losey's film parable of tolerance and pacifism that was way ahead of its time.

The story of two English women living in India more than fifty years apart. Olivia shares a troubled marriage with Douglas Rivers, an English civil servant in the colonial India of the 1920s. Anne, Olivia's grand niece, comes to the subcontinent -- thirty years after the sun has set on the British empire -- to investigate Olivia's life, which her family regarded as ""something dark and terrible"". Shortly after her passage to India in 1923, the beautiful young Olivia finds herself bored by English colonial social circles -- she wonders how people who lead such exciting lives could remain so dull -- though she is entranced by India itself. Olivia is introduced to the Nawab of Khatm, a romantic and decadent minor prince who enjoys a Forsterian intimacy with his British confidant, Harry. The willful Englishwoman begins going to Khatm to spend time with the Nawab and they fall in love, engaging in an affair that is not without wrenching consequences in her public and private lives. In the present day of the film, Anne investigates Olivia's past with Inder Lal, her Indian landlord. Anne finds herself both in the same rooms and in the same predicament as her ancestress, as she herself becomes involved in a romantic entangelment with an Indian man. Heat And Dust cross-cuts between the lives of the two women as Anne discovers -- and then seems to repeat -- the scandal that her independent-minded ancestor caused two generations before. Anne must then re-assert her own independence, fifty years later...

-No parents. No rules. 

A group of teen-age runaways try to survive in the streets of Los Angeles. Drugs, prostitution, violence and bureaucratic indifference all pose threats to the kids, who nevertheless prefer this harsh life to going back to their families. Heather, somewhat older, provides some leadership and mothering to the kids. 

In Los Angeles, the gang of teenagers leaded by King survives on the streets begging, prostituting and stealing money. Among King's best friends are Little J, who is a gay prostitute; Greg, who is drug addicted capable of stealing to buy drugs with the dealer Ted; and the paralytic Manny. When the newcomer and runaway from Chicago Heather meets King, they fall in love for each other. But when Little J kills Tommy Ray to protect King, he is falsely accused of murder and chased by the police, with tragic consequences.

Where the Day Takes You is a tour of Hollywood's notorious underground. From the after-hours dance clubs to the hidden drug dens, from panhandling to prostitution, it's a no-holds-barred look at life in the fast lane. Fleeing abusive families, the kids form a protective family on their own, with King as their leader. When King gets falsely accused of murder, the ""family"" is now forced to take the law into their own hands and survive on their own ways. It doesn't take long before the group falls apart. When King gets released, will he be able to make everything better and teach his family a better way to survive?

Until now old Schwartz has lead a quiet life divided between Linda, a young Filipino woman who takes care of him, Aviram, his neighbor who never goes out without his dog, and Mali, whose love affair with Ilan across the courtyard doesn’t bother him at all. But it would appear that everything has got out of synch recently, for now the building constantly resounds with yelling and screaming.
 Is it because of Hezi, who has secretly rented an apartment to make love with his mistress, Gabi, whose cries of pleasure bring everyone out of their houses? Or could it be the new neighbors who’re extending their apartment into the courtyard, although they don’t have a building permit? Even Mali has problems. The builder responsible for the extension has set up camp with his Chinese workers outside her apartment. He just happens to be her ex-husband, and to top it off, their son, Eyal, has just deserted the army.
 The film chronicles the daily lives of the inhabitants of a building situated at the edge of Tel-Aviv and Jaffa.

Held yearly for centuries, the Ocean of Fire--a 3,000 mile survival race across the Arabian desert--was a challenge restricted to the finest Arabian horses ever bred, the purest and noblest lines, owned by the greatest royal families. In 1890, a wealthy sheik invited an American, Frank T. Hopkins, and his horse to enter the race for the first time. During the course of his career, Hopkins was a cowboy and dispatch rider for the U.S. cavalry--and had once been billed as the greatest rider the West had ever known. The Sheik puts his claim to the test, pitting the American cowboy and his mustang, Hidalgo, against the world's greatest Arabian horses and Bedouin riders--some of whom are determined to prevent a foreigner from finishing the race. For Frank, the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride and honor, but a race for his very survival as he and his horse attempt the impossible.

I noticed the trailer for this film is no longer on youtube, so I thought I'd upload it again. Based on Grace Metalious's bestseller, Lana Turner received not only an Oscar nomination but also a career rejuvenation when she played the role of Constance MacKenzie, the mother of a teenage girl who carries a secret. Diane Varsi, in her film debut, is Alison, who dreams of becoming a writer, and is unaware of the circumstances surrounding her birth. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that Constance and Alison are not the only ones who have problems - Alison's best friend Selena Cross (Hope Lange) lives on the wrong side of the tracks and tries to fend off her abusive and lecherous stepfather, Lucas (Arthur Kennedy); her mother, Nellie (Betty Field) worn down by years of poverty, drudgery and her husband's drunken rages, works as a maid in the MacKenzie house; Selena's boyfriend, Ted Carter (David Nelson) wants to go to law school but has to work to earn enough money to attend college; shy and awkward Norman Page (Russ Tamblyn) has a domineering mother and spends hours in the library after school to avoid going home; Rodney Harrington (Barry Coe), son of the wealthiest and successful man in town, Leslie (Leon Ames), is in love with the town ""fast girl"", Betty Anderson (Terry Moore), of which his father disapproves. Doctor Matthew Swain (Lloyd Nolan) is the voice of reason and the heart of Peyton Place, and Mrs. Thornton (Mildred Dunnock) is the beloved school teacher who is up for the position of principal but loses out to newcomer Mike Rossi (Lee Phillips), whose arrival sets into motion a chain of events.  Turner, Lange, Varsi, Tamblyn and Kennedy all received Oscar nominations for their roles, and the film inspired a sequel and a television series. Of course, the novel had many more sub-plots and characters, and some events were either left out entirely or altered to suit the production code, which was breaking down at the time but still demanding that certain things either happen offscreen or presented in a way that was deemed ""acceptable"". Exterior scenes were shot in Camden, Maine, after the residents of Grace Metalious's hometown in New Hampshire refused to have anything to do with the making of the film. Apparently, the fact that Metalious had been inspired by people and events that took place not only in her hometown but some of the surrounding communities as well did not endear her to them. Set in the '40s, the film very much has '50s sensibilities, but to me that makes it all the more fascinating.  Enjoy!",71033,188,17,PT2M40S,0

4713,zMnWQB7p7uk,John Landis on ONE MILLION YEARS BC,"This is the way it wasn't!  A longtime favorite with Creationists, this loose remake of the 1940 cavemen-vs.dinosaurs epic made a star of unknown Raquel Welch despite the fact she has almost no dialog. Its success, which led to several further prehistoric adventures from Hammer, was eclipsed by the phenomenal reaction to a single iconic publicity still of the star in her fur bikini, which became a wildly popular poster and cultural touchstone. Ray Harryhausen, who supplied the mostly stop-motion monsters, made only four more films before retiring. The US release was cut by 9 minutes, since restored.

Prey for Rock & Roll (2003) Official Trailer - Gina Gershon Movie HD

Prey For Rock & Roll is the story of Jacki and her all-girl rock and roll band, Clam Dandy, who are trying to make it in the LA club scene of the late 1980s. After ten years of being ignored by record producers, Jacki and the band find hope in one producer who promises to see them play and consider them for a contract. Jacki resolves to play this one last gig and then throw in the towel if she does not find success. Personal tragedies, however, threaten to rip the band apart, rocking the foundation of friendship and trust the women have built together. Ultimately, the band must find its strength in the music that is their passion and the thread that holds them together, inspiring them to prevail.",29600,142,18,PT2M18S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Ned (Mick Jagger) heads to the gallows.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Ned Kelly (Mick Jagger) is the legendary outlaw of the Australian outback sought by authorities for stealing horses. At age 20, Ned has already served a three-year prison term at hard labor. When Ned's mother (Clarissa Kaye) is arrested and jailed on a bogus murder charge, Ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother's freedom. When the authorities refuse, the Kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage. Cornered by the law in a saloon, Ned's brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive. Shel Silverstein wrote the music performed by Waylon Jennings, Jagger and Glen Tomasetti. Australian folk songs are also included in this story taken from a popular 19th-century ballad.

4724,DxMft223FUA,Road To Bali,"Road to Bali is a 1952 American comedy film directed by Hal Walker and starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. Released by Paramount Pictures on November 1, 1952, the film is the sixth of the seven Road to ... movies. It was the only such movie filmed in color and was the first to feature surprise cameo appearances from other well-known stars of the day.
PLOT:
George and Harold, American song-and-dance men performing in Melbourne, Australia, leave in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals. They end up in Darwin, where they take jobs as pearl divers for a prince. They are taken by boat to an idyllic island on the way to Bali, Indonesia. They vie for the favours of exotic (and half-Scottish) Princess Lala, a cousin of the Prince. A hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels, which the Prince plans to claim as his own.
After escaping from the Prince and his henchmen, the three are shipwrecked and washed up on another island. Lala is now in love with both of the boys and can't decide which to choose. However, once the natives find them, she learns that in their society, a woman may take multiple husbands, and declares she will marry them both. While the boys are prepared for the ceremony, both thinking the other man lost, plans are changed. She's being unwillingly wed to the already much-married King, while the boys end up married to each other.
Displeased with the arrangement, a volcano god initiates a massive eruption. After fleeing, the three end up on yet another beach where Lala chooses George over Harold. An undaunted, Harold conjures up Jane Russell from a basket by playing a flute. Alas, she, too, rejects Harold, which means George walks off with both Lala and Jane. A lonesome Harold is left on the beach, demanding that the film shouldn't finish and asking the audience to stick around to see what's going to happen next.
CAST:
Bing Crosby as George Cochran
Bob Hope as Harold Gridley
Dorothy Lamour as Princess Lala McTavish
CAMEO APPEARANCES:
Among the celebrities who made appearances in this film are bandleader Bob Crosby (Bing's brother), Humphrey Bogart, by way of a clip from The African Queen, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, and Jane Russell as her character from the 1952 film Son of Paleface. The cameo by Martin and Lewis was part of a 'comedy trade' whereby they made an appearance in this movie while Hope and Crosby appeared in Martin and Lewis's ""Scared Stiff"" the following year. Martin and Lewis also made films for Paramount at the time.

Whitwell, TN is a small, rural community of less than two thousand people nestled in the mountains of Tennessee. Its citizens are almost exclusively white and Christian. In 1998, the children of Whitwell Middle School took on an inspiring project, launched out of their principal's desire to help her students open their eyes to the diversity of the world beyond their insulated valley. What happened would change the students, their teachers, their families and the entire town forever... and eventually open hearts and minds around the world.
PAPER CLIPS is the moving and inspiring documentary film that captures how these students responded to lessons about the Holocaust-with a promise to honor every lost soul by collecting one paper clip for each individual exterminated by the Nazis. Despite the fact that they had previously been unaware of and unfamiliar with the Holocaust, their dedication was absolute. Their plan was simple but profound. The amazing result, a memorial railcar filled with 11 million paper clips (representing 6 million Jews and 5 million gypsies, homosexuals and other victims of the Holocaust) which stands permanently in their schoolyard, is an unforgettable lesson of how a committed group of children and educators can change the world one classroom at a time.
PAPER CLIPS, presented by One Clip At A Time HMA, is a production of The Johnson Group, in association with Miramax Films and Ergo Entertainment. It was named one of the top films of 2004 (documentary) by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, has been acclaimed by critics as ""Oscar caliber"" (Joel Siegel, Good Morning America), and has received audience and jury awards at film festivals across the country.",50293,104,20,PT1M39S,0

4747,0fKI6uwZbxM,Carandiru (2003) - Movie Trailer,"Hailed as the triumphant return of Hector Babenco, you may be forgiven for asking, ""Who he?"" As the Brazilian director of Kiss Of The Spider Woman and Ironweed in the Eighties, he became the breath that freshened the air of Hollywood - briefly.

Now, he re-emerges on home ground with an epic prison movie, based on Drauzio Varella's experience as the sole medical officer at the notorious Carandiru jail in Sao Paolo, before it was demolished after riots.
Copy picture

The recreation of life behind bars for murderers and drug dealers is depicted with astonishing energy and style. The performances are uniformly good, while, at times, shaking the foundations with unrestrained verocity.

Unlike another Brazilian street movie, City Of God, there exists at its core an underlying sentimentality. The prison has an organic life. Inmates look after each other and administer rough justice for acts of violence that are deemed to have broken a code of honour. The guards stay back and allow the rule of law - convict law - to keep the pressure of confinement from blowing the roof off. There is a flexibility, based on acceptance, between governor and governed, respecting the rights of each and the other, while recognising their shared humanity.

Babenco focuses on a handful of prisoners. With the use of flashbacks, their lives and crimes are superficially investigated, while the doctor (Luiz Carlos Vasconcelos), who performs the role of educator and Everyman, remains in the neutral zone.

A rich man's morality is wasted on the hardcore; killing seems easier than sleep. Carandiru is another country, with its own idiosyncrasies. Cliches are noticable by their absence, although the lags are surprisingly well equipped with human qualities and the degree of self-expression allowed by the prison staff reflects Christian decency on a scale hitherto unimaginable.

Babenco conveys the big picture, including the vicious suppression of dissent, deemed worthy of riot status, extremely well. It's on the personal level that a softening occurs, as if pain as raw as this needs to be diluted to make it palatable for public consumption.

French release: 20/08/2003 
Production year: 2002 

The Germans are at Paris's door...
 Odile gets caught up in the widespread panic and flees with her two children, Philippe, 13, and her daughter Cathy, 7. Like everyone else, they head south.
 They drive without stopping on the overcrowded roads, slowed down by the masses traveling by foot. Hunger and thirst begin to overtake them. On the second day of their journey, German Stuka planes machine gun the column of refugees.
 The car bursts into flame. Odile and her children lose everything. A teenage boy leads them into a neighboring forest to protect them from the aerial bombardment. What should they do, go deeper into the forest or return to the danger of the road?
 They spend the night in the forest, sleeping outdoors. Early in the morning, they wander through the empty countryside. It's like being on a deserted island. They're cut off from the world, far from the war and maybe even from the march of time... They head for the unknown.

The Angels have to 'create' a human being smart enough to find the Stone Tablets, and willing to sacrifice his or her life in order to return the Tablets to Heaven. 

The Angels design an ingenious and at the same time merciless plan to achieve their goal. The plan shapes up when two men on earth meet each other apparently by coincidence. One is Onno Quist (Stephen Fry), an eccentric linguist and son of a former Prime Minister. The other is Max Delius (Greg Wise), son of a Nazi father and a Jewish mother. The two men become friends. Only one person can intrude into the intimacy of their friendship: Ada Brons (Flora Montgomery), a young cello player.

Ada becomes pregnant. She doesn't know whether Max or Onno is the father. The boy born, Quinten, rapidly develops as a very special and very gifted child. Is he the chosen one? Will he be capable to complete the Angels task?
 
Starring Stephen Fry (Wilde, V for Vendetta, Gosford Park), Greg Wise (Johnny English) and actor & director Jeroen Krabbe (The Fugitive, The Living Daylights).  The Discovery of Heaven is an adaptation of Harry Mulisch's epic philosophical novel.

Three centuries ago, a precious sword has been stolen by Kazamatsuri -- the sword, which historic and symbolic value is priceless for the clan (Shogun Tokugawa donated it to clan 80 years before that, at the same time that he established them as the local rulers). Lord's counselor's young son Heishiro goes to retrieve the sword himself to protect the clan from the shame or possible demise. He is accompanied with two friends, Shintaro and Tadasuke, and followed by the ninjas of the clan. After Kazamatsuri wounds Heishiro and kills one of his friends, the young aristocrat still wants revenge more than sword itself, but meanwhile have to recover from his wounds, in the small forest house of a lonely samurai and his daughter. At the same time, Kamazatsuri stays in nearby town in the entertainment center run by Okatsu and falls into her. The older samurai tries to dissuade Heishiro from fighting with Kamazatsuri, but is himself gradually drawn into the conflict.",3379,15,1,PT1M33S,0

4910,xNrygTqx0FA,Monterey Pop Official Trailer,"The Monterey Pop Festival ran for three days in June 1967. For most of the five shows, the arena was jammed to bursting with perhaps as many as 10,000 people. The live performances were spectacularly successful. Janis Joplin, who was singing with Big Brother and the Holding Company, pulled out all the stops with a raw, powerful performance that helped establish her as the preeminent female rock singer of her day.

The Who climaxed a brilliant set by smashing their equipment at the conclusion of ""My Generation"". Jimi Hendrix (in the American debut of the Jimi Hendrix Experience) offered an awesome display of his virtuosity as a guitarist and as a showman, humping his Marshall amplifiers and then setting his Stratocaster ablaze. Another highlight was Ravi Shankar's meditative afternoon of Indian ragas. And then there was Otis Redding, the dynamic soul man turned in what many present believe was the festival's best performance. ABC offered $400,000 for network rights to Pennebaker's film (which was released in theaters after ABC decided it was too far out for the TV audience).

Living by those words, PK (Dorff) fights with his fists and leads with his heart as he grows to manhood. He takes on the system and the injustices he sees around him -- and finds that one person really can make a difference. *1976 Best Director for Rocky.

Directed By John G. Avildsen
Starring Stephen Dorff, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Morgan Freeman

While on a train, the two meet a handsome, rakish officer, Tolyan, who seduces the mother. Katya stays with Tolyan, who pretends to be her husband and acts as a stepfather to Sanya, who is at first highly distrustful of the man, resenting his presence and authority. There are several allusions to Hamlet.

Through his good looks, apparent generosity, and his status as a war veteran, Tolyan charms his way into a variety of lucrative positions. Katya and Sanya both realize the harsh and increasingly abusive nature of the new head of their family, but, although alarmed, neither mother nor child seems willing to leave the man. The extent of Tolyan's love for his new family remains ambiguous throughout the film and provides one of the more compelling elements of the story.",493585,1767,153,PT1H33M33S,0

The release delay on many countries maybe explains the reason why in Western countries such as the U.S. and Great Britain it was rleased under the title ""Sky Blue"" and in other countries under the title ""Wonderful Days"".

Its a Koren production directed by Kim Moon-saeng. The movie includes really great quality sounds, music and computer graphics far greater than other anime movies of that time using highly detailed models for some of the backdrops into which the cel animated characters were animated..
Some say that the computer graphics of this movie are comparable to those in the film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.

The film was scheduled for release in the US on Blu-ray disc but yet uknown when. ..

Once upon a time sweet dreams were delivered to people while they slept from sunny Frivoli, and nightmares came from the mysterious Murkworks. But the rulers of Murkworks were not content--they wanted everyone to suffer nightmares every night. So they tricked the Deliverers of Dreams to bring them the mainspring of the Cosmic Clock, knowing that whoever controls the Cosmic Clock controls time and the universe. Now a battle has been engaged to restore the balance of dreams, as the most magical creatures that can be imagined enter the fray.

4991,XSdeNGCG-Aw,The Way Ahead (1944) [War] [Drama],"If you like this movie and our channel, please subscribe: https://goo.gl/0qDmXe | ""The Way Ahead"" is a British Second World War drama released in 1944. It stars David Niven and Stanley Holloway and follows a group of civilians who are conscripted into the British Army to fight in North Africa. In the U.S., an edited version was released as ""The Immortal Battalion"". The film was written by Eric Ambler and Peter Ustinov and directed by Carol Reed. The three had originally produced the 1943 training film ""The New Lot"", which was produced for the Army Kinematograph Service. ""The Way Ahead"" was an expanded remake of their earlier film, this time intended for a commercial audience. The two films featured some of the same actors, including John Laurie, Raymond Huntley and Peter Ustinov. 

In the days after the Dunkirk evacuation in Second World War, Lieutenant Jim Perry (David Niven), a veteran of the British Expeditionary Force, is posted to the Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry to train replacements to fill its depleted ranks. A patient, mild-mannered officer, he does his strenuous best to turn the bunch of grumbling ex-civilians into soldiers, earning himself their intense dislike. Eventually however, the men come to respect their officer.

After their training is completed, their battalion is shipped out to North Africa to face Rommel's Afrika Korps. However, their ship is torpedoed en route, and they miss the fighting. They are assigned to guard a small town. Perry appropriates a cafe as his headquarters, much to the disgust of the pacifist owner, Rispoli (Peter Ustinov). When the Germans attack, Perry and his men fiercely defend their positions, aided by Rispoli. The last scene shows them advancing in a counter-attack. Instead of the film ending with the words ""The End"", it concludes with the more uplifting ""The Beginning"", an attempt to galvanize support for the final push in the war effort. The final scene of the advancing soldiers was also copied for the closing credits of the long-running sitcom Dad's Army; John Laurie appeared in both and his performance in the sitcom credits mirrors this film.

5007,KobbZ8VDI00,Ten Little Indians (1965) - Trailer,"Trailer for the 1965 film version of Agatha Christie's 1939 novel, ""Ten Little [whatevers, depending on how old you were when you purchased the novel]"".

This was the first of three adaptations produced by Harry Alan Towers and uses a near identical script to the 1974 version. Moving the action away from an island off the English coast, 1965 finds the victims situated high in the Austrian alps; in 1974, they were relocated to an empty Iranian hotel; by 1989, the story inexplicably took place on an African safari.

Here, the titular ten are played by: Hugh O'Brian, Shirley Eaton, Stanley Holloway, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Dennis Price, Leo Genn, Daliah Lavi, Marianne Hoppe, Mario Adorf and Fabian. Christopher Lee provides the [uncredited] voice of Mr. U. N. Owen.

Personally,  I consider this version the best of Towers' three efforts. He hired actors who, while not quite headliners, were still way up most cast lasts and so were both fairly cheap but highly recognisable. For example, Shirley Eaton had recently been covered in gold paint in ""Goldfinger"", while both Stanley Holloway and Wilfrid Hyde-White had appeared in the high-profile (indeed, Best Picture winner) ""My Fair Lady"". Dennis Price had been a huge matinee idol, although by 1965 his star was somewhat diminishing and he would soon be relegated to the domain of Brit-horror (and the far inferior world of Spanish horror). Daliah Lavi would have ensured bums of cinema seats on the continent, while presumably Fabian would sell the picture to the Americans. (If you aren't one of Fabian's fans, fear not, he's the first to die...) Towers also engaged the services of George Pollock, who had done a very creditable job of directing the four MGM Miss Marple films starring Margaret Rutherford.

The film was released in America by Warner Bros. on a DVD with excellent picture quality and a trailer. This release included the ""Whodunnit Break"" in the body of the film. Similarly, it was released in Europe by Studio Canal with the ""Whodunnit Break"" intact, but no trailer - in the UK, this Studio Canal disc was only available as part of The Agatha Christie Film Collection partwork. Otherwise, Britain was lumbered with a poor quality disc from Black Horse / Orbit which suffers from a ghosting problem - however, as a plus point, it only includes the ""Whodunnit Break"" as a [separate] extra - to my mind, this is a good thing as it kills the film stone dead, and offers no clues, but merely snippets of each preceding murder in turn.

The film is much better than this trailer suggests - and that bloody annoying child singing over the trailer is not included in the film.

Please do NOT ask for the whole film to be uploaded - in any event, it won't be. Also, any comments giving spoilers will be deleted.",117523,333,9,PT2M9S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After directing the first two movies in the Harry Potter franchise, Chris Columbus opted to serve as producer for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and passed the baton to Y Tu Mamá También director Alfonso Cuarón. Though ""immensely popular"" is an understatement when it comes to Harry Potter, Azkaban is somewhat of a departure from its predecessors, and particularly beloved among fans for its surprise ending. Prisoner of Azkaban also marks the introduction of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who has escaped from the title prison after 12 years of incarceration. Believed to have been the right-hand-man of the dark wizard Voldemort, whom Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) mysteriously rendered powerless during his infancy, some of those closest to Harry suspect Black has returned to exact revenge on the boy who defeated his master. Upon his return to school, however, Harry is relatively unconcerned with Black. Run by Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) -- who is widely regarded as the most powerful wizard of the age -- Hogwarts is renowned for its safety. Harry's nonchalance eventually turns to blind rage after accidentally learning the first of Black's many secrets during a field trip to a neighboring village. Of course, a loose serial killer is only one of the problems plaguing the bespectacled wizard's third year back at school -- the soul-sucking guards of Azkaban prison have been employed at Hogwarts to protect the students, but their mere presence sends Harry into crippling fainting spells. With the help of his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), and Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Harry struggles to thwart the Dementors, find Sirius Black, and uncover the mysteries of the night that left him orphaned.

Ichi (Takeshi Kitano) aka Zatoichi, slices up a couple of roving bandits when they try to intimidate him.

Napoleon Dynamite is a high school student from Preston, Idaho who lives with his grandmother, his older brother Kip, and their pet llama, Tina. Kip, 32, is currently unemployed and boasts of spending hours in Internet chat rooms with ""babes"" and training to be a cage fighter; their grandmother leads a secret life involving mysterious boyfriends and quad-biking in the desert. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, doodling ligers and fantasy creatures, while reluctantly dealing with the assorted bullies who frequently torment him. To make himself appear more interesting and dangerous than he is, Napoleon frequently makes up fantastic stories about himself and responds to being questioned with unprovoked anger.
Napoleon's grandmother breaks her coccyx in a quad-bike accident and, believing her grandsons cannot be trusted to look after themselves, asks their Uncle Rico to look after them while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged former athlete who lives in a campervan, uses the opportunity to team up with Kip in a get rich quick scheme to sell various items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the loss of his girlfriend.
Napoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to finance her college career; and Pedro, a transfer student from Ciudad Juárez. The three quickly develop a close friendship as the school's outcasts. Inspired by a poster at the school dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer Wheatley, a popular yet arrogant girl at the school.
Rico and Kip's scheme causes frictionnamite: [referring to Deb's milk] I see you're drinking 1%. Is that 'cause you think you're fat? 'Cause you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to.

The versatile Robert Wise fills the Scope screen with intelligent spectacle, aided by memorable second unit work by Yakima Canutt and an uncredited Sergio Leone.

Kings Row is one of Warner Bros.’ most distinguished productions, highlighted by an outstanding cast, haunting James Wong Howe cinematography and a somber, emotion-laden Erich Wolfgang Korngold score.

Oomph Girl Ann Sheridan, Robert Cummings, Betty Field, Claude Rains and Charles Coburn give indelible performances – and Ronald Reagan’s portrayal of Drake, a cheerful ne’er-do-well shattered by tragedy, has been hailed as a career high.

Overboard Trailer - Directed by Garry Marshall and starring Kurt Russell, Edward Herrmann, Mike Hagerty, Roddy McDowall, Jared Rushton. A kind of African Queen gone berserk, ""Overboard"" chronicles the misadventures of a bitchy society queen (Goldi Hawn) who lives on a luxury yacht with her class-conscious husband (Edward Herrmann) and put-upon butler (Roddy McDowall). When the yacht docks for ""repairs"" (that is, for more closet space), Hawn refuses to pay the local carpenter (Kurt Russel) because he used oak instead of cedar for the closets. The argument results in Hawn pushing Russel overboard. Hawn falls overboard herself and is rescued by a garbage scow. However, she remembers nothing of her pampered past. Through a series of high-energy, high-wit escapades the two protagonists find each other, the kids turn into lollipops and all is well that ends well.

-------

""Freedom Downtime"" is the story of computer hacker Kevin Mitnick, imprisoned without bail for nearly five years. 

The film tries to uncover the reasons why the authorities are so scared of Mitnick as well as define what exactly he did. 

As word of a new Hollywood movie portraying Mitnick as a terrorist becomes known, hackers begin to turn to activism to get their message out. 

Through interviews with relatives, friends, lawyers, and experts in the computer and civil liberties arena, a picture of a great injustice becomes apparent. 

A cross country journey uncovers some realities of the hacker culture as well as the sobering reality that so many technically adept young people seem destined for prison.

Winner of the ""Audience Award for Documentaries"" at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival, 2002

TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS,"""Hammer competitor Amicus Films found their mojo with this 1964 multi-story horror omnibus, which led to countless iterations of the same formula, including their biggest hit """"Tales from the Crypt"""". The genius of the portmanteau system was that the actors were often needed for only a few days, which allowed for casts that were almost ridiculously classy.""

5129,zjv__VAzBKM,Confessions of a Burning Man,"SYNOPSIS: The film Confessions of a Burning Man investigates the evolution of a generation driven by technology and social/environmental responsibility. The object of this documentary is to raise awareness of Burning Man in a positive light. The media today is notoriously sensationalistic, focusing on appearance rather than content. 

Our focus, in conjunction with Larry Harvey, the founder of Burning Man, is to explore Burning Man on two levels: Community and Art. (An event where no money is exchanged and absolutely no corporate sponsorship.) 

What makes this film special was the access given to some of the amazing people behind the scenes who make Burning Man happen, add that to the beautifull cinematography shot of the event and specially of the Burn and Temple of Tears, and it all add's up to make this DVD a great way to show your friends what the Burn is all about and for you to re-live it over again. 

Directed by Unsu Lee and Paul Barnet. 

THE SCORE: The score was produced and written by Graham Shrimpton aka DJ Darkhorse of Three Sixty Records in San Francisco. The Music created for Confessions of a Burning Man was a year in the making, with many talented musicians helping in the recording. The Songs ""Crash and Burn"", ""End Song"" and ""Temple of Tears"" were all inspired by, and scored to the film. Great music also in the film comes from the artists Balanced Output, Runaways UK, The Beloved, Bonobo and Kdub",9310,19,4,PT2M3S,0

The quote reads: 

When I had opened the fifth seal I saw the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the Word of God. ""Sovereign Lord, Holy And True, how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the Earth?"" It was the darkest hour of the long, dark night of the soul. The chill center of divine callousness. What twisted fairy tale had I allowed myself to be tangled up into. What misplaced gratitude had I believed to be awe. Why had I let these souls believe there was anything other than sacrifice? Why were they comforted with dreams of vengeance? Why hadn't I interefered more? Agitated? Questioned? Revolted? Panicked by both the legitimacy and the hopelessness of their cries I rose to the occasion and lied. ""Rest a little while longer until the number of your fellows will be complete.

It's the year 2035, and the community now has the help of robots. These robots have three laws integrated into their system. One, they cannot harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Two, they must do whatever they're told by a human being as long as such orders don't conflict with law one. Three, they have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently jumps out of the tenth-floor window of U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe that he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner (Smith), who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the number one suspect is a Nestor Class-5 robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then that means he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now discover the truth before it's too late.",1799755,2546,786,PT2M30S,0

In the sixteenth century, Miguel de Cervantes, poet, playwright, and part-time actor, has been arrested, together with his manservant, by the Spanish Inquisition. They are accused of presenting an entertainment offensive to the Inquisition. Inside the huge dungeon into which they have been cast, the other prisoners gang up on Cervantes and his manservant, and begin a mock trial, with the intention of stealing or burning his possessions. Cervantes wishes to desperately save a manuscript he carries with him and stages, with costumes, makeup, and the participation of the other prisoners, an unusual defense--the story of Don Quixote.

The Bachelor is Dickie Nugent (Grant), a sophisticated and debonaire artist - no wonder Bobby-Soxer Susan Turner (Shirley Temple) develops such a crush on him. It doesn't matter to her that she's just seventeen and he's in his forties...

When Susan is found in Dickie's studio after hours, he's hauled before the judge - who just happens to be Susan's older sister Margaret (Myrna Loy). Although convinced that Dickie is blameless, Margaret devises an inventive punishment - he has to take Susan out on 'dates' until her infatuation fades.

There can only be one.
Smuggler. Prince. Murderer. Father. Sinner. Saint.

Tai-Pan is a 1986 film directed by Daryl Duke, loosely based on James Clavell's 1966 novel of the same name. Filmed under communist Chinese censorship, some portions of Clavell's story were considered too offensive to be filmed as written and considerable changes were made. The De Laurentiis Entertainment Group handled the production and were actively seen battling the Chinese Government and Labor boards over the film during shooting. Director Daryl Duke believed that a mini-series à la Shōgun or Noble House would have been a far superior means of covering the complexity of Clavell's novel.

There had been numerous attempts to film Tai Pan over the years. Patrick McGoohan was announced to play Dirk Struan in a version for MGM in 1968 which was postponed due to high costs, despite Carlo Ponti and Martin Ransohoff as producers and Michael Anderson attached to direct.",106010,182,42,PT2M4S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
When Neil (Richard Benjamin) visits Brenda (Ali MacGraw) at college, they get into an argument about why she left her diaphragm at home for her mother to find.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Based on one of author Phillip Roth's shorter works, Goodbye Columbus stars Richard Benjamin as Neil, a young man of humble means who falls in love with Jewish-American-princess Brenda (Ali MacGraw). Their romance is out of the question so far as Brenda's suburbanite parents are concerned, so Neil and Brenda rendezvous in some of the sleaziest motels ever seen in a 1960s film (and that assessment includes The Bates Motel). Unwilling to take birth control pills because they upset her tummy, Brenda opts for a diaphragm, which unfortunately is discovered by her mother. Their rocky relationship comprises the bulk of the film. The trendy, New Wave-influenced direction by Larry Peerce gained a great deal of critical attention in 1969, notably such self-indulgent devices as having a close-up of a girl's navel dissolve into a long-shot of a swimming pool. Far more memorable is Peerce's amusingly straight-on depictions of upper-class Jewish/American social functions. In their film debuts, Richard Benjamin and Ali MacGraw are appealingly awkward; the more memorable performance is delivered by Michael Meyers as MacGraw's adenoidal younger brother.

Movie Review: Under the Lighthouse Dancing (1997) featuring Naomi Watts. The Movie Show is an Australian film review program which is broadcast on SBS TV.
Under The Lighthouse Dancing is a first feature from an unlikely source - writer/director Graeme Rattigan is no graduate of film school, he`s not making the leap to feature films after a series of shorts - he`s a lawyer who decided that writing and directing films was what he wanted to do. His story of a couple, Harry - Jack Thompson - and Emma - Jacqueline McKenzie - who invite four friends to their island holiday home for the weekend, where they intend to get married, is underlaid by tragedy...it`s no accident that one of the friends is Emma`s doctor... Harry might have thought the idea of getting married that weekend is great, but he`s done nothing to organise it; it`s the friends who band together and work like mad to create a magic moment for Harry and Emma. Rattigan says he wanted to make a film about the power of love; unfortunately the film`s a bit `Seventies New Age`, too much feelgood, too little solid drama - and unfortunately Rattigan hasn`t given much depth to any of his characters. We hardly know anything about them and we don`t learn all that much during the film. Jack Thompson and Jacqueline McKenzie give two of the more mannered performances in the film, but they`re hampered by their characters; more natural are Aiden Gillet and Naomi Watts, who play two single friends who discover something together on the island. On the technical side, the film looks wonderful - it was mostly shot on Rottnest Island, and Larry Eastwood`s design with Paul Murphy`s cinematography makes you wish for more oomph in the screenplay. Under The Lighthouse Dancing is a film that obviously wants to have an emotional impact, it just hasn`t done it very successfully.",4614,9,2,PT2M25S,0

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Sonya (Diana Rigg) wants Ivan (Oliver Reed) killed and he thinks it's a marvelous idea.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The Assassination Bureau is loosely based on a turn-of-the-century yarn written by Jack London. Nellie Bly-style girl reporter Sonya Winter (Diana Rigg) tries to get the goods on shady businessman Ivan Dragomiloff (Oliver Reed). Ivan is in charge of a wide-reaching organization which, for a price, assassinates those who ""need killing."" As a challenge, Sonya offers to pay Ivan a huge sum if he'll instruct his minions to assassinate him; Ivan agrees, hoping that it will put a little kick in his work. Despite his profession, Ivan isn't the villain of the piece; that honor goes to evil nobleman Lord Bostwick (Telly Savalas), whose perfidy leads Sonya into joining forces with the Assassination Bureau. A wild climactic chase in a zeppelin caps this tongue-in-cheek escapade.

But the real reason to smile is Bruce Dern’s funny and touching performance as Big Bob Freelander, head judge of the contest and sometime used car dealer. Once again Ritchie takes an overflowing cast of characters (including Barbara Feldon and Melanie Griffith) and gives each one of them their due. Annette O’Toole has a memorable moment as a demurely sexy contestant who finds a provocative way to catch the judges’ attention.

Synopsis

Un jeune officier de marine, le lieutenant Jim, embarque comme second à bord d'un navire pour convoyer un groupe de pèlerins. Mais quand surgit la tempête, il fuit par lâcheté, laissant les passagers à leur funeste destin. Pris de remords et animé d'un désir de rédemption, il se lance dans une aventure en Malaisie. Il participe au soulèvement de la population contre un dictateur et brille par son courage. Mais l'orgueil le rend imprudent et trop téméraire.

At the same time, Henri meets a boy at school, Chat Turly, and becomes infatuated with his seemingly ideal wealthy family.

5281,h-m1hKqMfaU,The Last Shot (trailer),"http://video.movies.go.com/products/03598600.html
The Last Shot is a 2004 action comedy film starring Matthew Broderick, Alec Baldwin, Toni Collette, Tim Blake Nelson, an uncredited Joan Cusack, Tony Shalhoub, Ray Liotta and Calista Flockhart. The movie is written and directed by Jeff Nathanson, who wrote The Terminal and Catch Me if You Can.

Background:
The plot of The Last Shot is loosely based on the true story of an FBI sting operation code-named Dramex. The sting operation was run by FBI agent Garland Schweickhardt, who recruited aspiring screenwriters Dan Lewk and David Levy to participate unwittingly in a sting operation aimed at ensnaring mobsters and Teamsters union officials in a bribery scheme. Under the pretext of producing a movie, the FBI planned to catch people taking bribes in exchanging for promising not to not make trouble when filmmakers used non-union truck drivers and non-union crew members. Shooting actually occurred in several cities including New Orleans and Las Vegas, while in other major cities, evidence was obtained without using an actual crew made up of FBI personnel. As the investigation progressed from city to city, sealed indictments were obtained and only unsealed when the operation was concluded. Many actual events happened during the shooting that were more hilarious than the movie portrays. The crew stranded in the desert between LA and Las Vegas by a broken down Rolls Royce. Arriving at the location in Las Vegas to find a genuine crew already there shooting Nasty Boys. The grip truck running into an elderly lady's car the first day of shooting in New Orleans and paying off the lady with hundreds peeled from a roll of bills. The operation eventually led to indictments against five individuals, several of whom were convicted. The movie itself was shut down before serious filming started. Lewk and Levy have yet to make a full-length feature film.

Guionistas: Lars von Trier, Niels Vørsel.
Actores: Lars von Trier (director de cine y doctor Mesmer), Niels Vørsel (guionista).

Dos cineastas tienen que escribir un guión de una película sobre la historia de un médico que trata de paliar una epidemia, pero que lo único que consigue es esparcirla todavía más. Para ello tratan de investigar las consecuencias que la peste negra tuvo en algunas ciudades italianas durante la Edad Media. 
Esta película es muy interesante ya que mezcla distintos géneros, no todos ellos de ficción como el horror o el documental al estilo ""así se hizo"", en donde hay también lugar para la reflexión sobre el cine danés. Es una película en blanco y negro al igual que las otras dos que componen la trilogía Europa.
En este largometraje ya se puede apreciar muchas de las reglas Dogma 95 aplicadas casi una década antes de crear el Voto de Castidad de Dogma 95: el rodaje se produce fuera de estudios, en el mismo lugar donde se produce la acción, con la cámara en mano y el formato de la película es en algunas escenas de 35 mm.
Esta película, que constituye la segunda parte de la trilogía Europa, no fue estrenada en ningún país de habla hispana y se hizo con un presupuesto mínimo.

From Oscar-winning director James Hill*  (Born Free, The Belstone Fox) comes this heart-warming adaptation of one of the best loved family stories of all time!

Black Beauty, a magnificent stallion, is born on a rundown family farm and loved by young Joe Evans (Mark Lester -- Oliver!). Growing up together, the boy and his horse are inseparable -- until the wicked new squire (Patrick Mower) forces the Evans family from the farm and steals Black Beauty away from Joe.

Escaping from his cruel new master, Black Beauty finds himself caught up in a series of adventures -- racing with gypsies, performing at the circus and even going to war. Back home, Joe has never given up hope of being reunited with Beauty, and is determined to find the great love of his childhood days once more...",99022,144,16,PT2M29S,0
5319,0YPmRMipnSM,The Five Obstructions movie trailer preview from cheapflix,"With THE FIVE OBSTRUCTIONS, notoriously mischievous director Lars von Trier performs yet another cinematic experiment. This time around, the Danish prankster tries to outwit his mentor, director Jorgen Leth, forcing him to remake his classic 1967 short, ""The Perfect Human,"" five different times, with a series of increasingly outlandish guidelines. His goal is to break down the abnormally stable Leth, teaching him a valuable life lesson in the process. In the first film, von Trier sends Leth to Cuba and sets his first seemingly insurmountable rule: make a film that consists of shots that are no longer than twelve frames at a time. Miraculously, Leth uses his forced limitations to create a beautiful work, which obviously irks von Trier. Next up, von Trier challenges Leth to return to Bombay--which he calls the ""most wretched place on Earth""--in order to confront some demons from his past. Once again, the clever mentor rises to the challenge. Frustrated and sensing defeat, von Trier's next challenge is deceptively simple: Leth must remake his film with no limitations whatsoever. He travels to Brussels and succeeds once again. After a foray into animation, von Trier creates the final obstruction, a film in which von Trier admits defeat and pays tribute to his mentor. THE FIVE OBSTRUCTIONS is a thoughtful, entertaining meditation on the filmmaking process.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Permian loses by inches; the coach (Billy Bob Thornton) and players absorb the loss.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
H.G. Bissinger's best-selling true-life account of a few months in the life of a high-school football team comes to the screen in this adaptation written and directed by Peter Berg. Odessa, TX, is an oil town in the western part of the state that's home to the Permian High School Panthers, the football team with the best winning record in the state. Odessa is a town with more than its share of problems; the decline of the oil business in Texas has set the city's economy into a tailspin, and racial tensions still erupt into violence on occasion. But football is the one thing that brings all the people of Odessa together, and on Friday nights every fall, as many as 20,000 people fill Permian's football stadium to watch Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) and his boys try to lead the team to victory. As Gaines works to build a winning team in a town where victory is prized above all else, however, his players struggle through the emotional trials common to any teenager and ponder the fact that there is little future in their hometown...and that a championship season can be as much a burden as a triumph. Friday Night Lights also stars Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, and country singer-turned-actor Tim McGraw.

5347,kHqtSQM-OIA,Fabled - Official Trailer,"""There once was a wolf named Lupold, who was black as coal, as thick as a tree trunk, and feared like death.""

Meet Joseph Fable.

Joseph just broke up with his girlfriend and is not taking it very well. His girlfriend might be plotting against him with their mutual psychiatrist. He suspects that the people at work might be responsible for his missing dog. Then there is that unshakable guilt over his past. It just might all be bearable, somehow possible to live through, if it weren't for those damned ""monsters"" that keep trying to kill him. Engulfed in a downward spiral into guilt and madness, Joseph tries to maintain his sanity as outside forces pull him towards a violent conclusion. Through an allegorical ""fable"" that is told in parallel with Joseph's struggle, we are left to decide for ourselves in the end, who is the crow and who is the wolf, was someone out to get Joseph, was it a stroke of bad luck, or was it all in his head?

5370,5YJqG8dqlUU,The Sheik (1921) - with Rudolph Valentino,"The plot of ""The Sheik"" is very different from that of ""Our Modern Maidens,"" but the mixed message about women and sexuality is the same. Lady Diana Mayo (Agnes Ayres) is admired for her independence, high spirit and modern ideas, but when she is kidnapped by an Arab sheik, Ahmed Ben Hassan (Rudolph Valentino), she finds herself falling under the spell of his exotic masculinity. In the popular  novel on which the film is based, Lady Diana learns to appreciate the sheik only after he takes her by force; in the film, he restrains himself and wins her with his consideration and respect for her. (When the film was re-released during the Code years, a scene of attempted rape had to be cut.)
Even so, the character of the sheik is recast for the film as the child of European parents, adopted by an Arab sheik; anti-miscegenation laws of the time would have precluded scenes suggesting romance and kisses between a European lady and an Arab man. The film was banned in Kansas City all the same. 
""The Sheik"" was crucial to Valentino's career as the greatest male sex symbol of the time--and created a huge backlash among American men, who boycotted the film and railed against the ""effeminacy"" of his screen image. He died at 31 in 1926, setting off a mass outpouring of grief among American women that was a significant moment in the history of Hollywood's power over the public imagination.",50321,180,35,PT12M27S,0

(Russian: Октябрь (Десять дней, которые потрясли мир);
translit. Oktyabr': Desyat' dney kotorye potryasli mir) is a Soviet silent film made in 1927 by Sergei Eisenstein, sometimes referred to simply as October in English.

It is a celebratory dramatization of the 1917 October Revolution.

The title is taken from John Reed's book on the Revolution, ""Ten Days That Shook The World"".

October was one of two films commissioned by the Soviet government to honour the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution (the other was Vsevolod Pudovkin's The End of St. Petersburg).

Eisenstein was chosen to head the project due to the international success he had achieved with The Battleship Potemkin in 1925 .

Nikolai Podvoisky, one of the troika who led the storming of the Winter Palace was responsible for the commission.

The scene of the storming was based more on the 1920 re-enactment involving Lenin and thousands of Red Guards, witnessed by 100,000 spectators, than the original occasion, which was far less photogenic.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October:_Ten_Days_That_Shook_the_World

Dmitri Shostakovich wrote his Symphony No. 2 in B major, Opus 14 and subtitled To October, for the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution.
It was first performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and the Academy Capella Choir under Nikolai Malko, on 5 November 1927.

Shostakovich later revisited the events of the October Revolution in his Twelfth Symphony, subtitled The Year 1917.

Soviet montage theory is an approach to understanding and creating cinema that relies heavily upon editing (montage is French for ""build, organize""). Although Soviet filmmakers in the 1920s disagreed about how exactly to view montage, Sergei Eisenstein marked a note of accord in ""A Dialectic Approach to Film Form"" when he noted that montage is ""the nerve of cinema"", and that ""to determine the nature of montage is to solve the specific problem of cinema"".
 
While several Soviet filmmakers, such as Lev Kuleshov, Dziga Vertov, and Vsevolod Pudovkin put forth explanations of what constitutes the montage effect, Eisenstein's view that ""montage is an idea that arises from the collision of independent thoughts"" wherein ""each sequential element is perceived not next to the other, but on top of the other"" has become most widely accepted.

Vi appare all'inizio come l'uomo che affila il rasoio con cui recide trasversalmente l'occhio sinistro di una donna, una delle più celebri immagini-choc del cinema, collegata con quella della luna piena. Non c'è una trama, ma soltanto insinuazioni, associazioni mentali, allusioni; non c'è una logica, tranne quella dell'incubo; non c'è una realtà, tranne quella dell'inconscio, del sogno e del desiderio. Nato nell'ambiente parigino del surrealismo, è probabilmente il più celebre film d'avanguardia del mondo, anche se non il più significativo e importante. Molti gli preferiscono il successivo L'Age d'or (1930). È il corrispettivo filmico del Primo Manifesto del Surrealismo (1924, ristampato da André Breton nel 1929) di cui condivide l'estetica di Lautréamont, l'influsso di Freud, la volontà rivoluzionaria di ispirazione marxiana con spunti presi da Buster Keaton e René Magritte. Il titolo incongruo deriva da Un perro andaluz, raccolta di poesie e prose di Buñuel, pubblicata nel 1927 sulla Gaceta Literaria di Madrid. Non è da escludere che abbia una connotazione polemica contro Federico García Lorca che nel 1928 aveva pubblicato Primero romancero gitano, accolto da molti con entusiastici elogi, ma non dall'amico Buñuel che gli rimproverava il terribile estetismo. Proiettato dal giugno 1929 allo Studio des Ursulines di Parigi, tenne il cartellone per molte settimane. Nel 1960 il regista-produttore ne cedette i diritti e fu sonorizzato con le musiche (Morte di Isotta di Wagner, tanghi argentini) scelte da Buñuel. L'attore protagonista, P. Batcheff, si suicidò pochi mesi dopo la fine delle riprese.",276411,252,16,PT54S,0

The year after the all-star Grand Hotel, brothers John and Lionel Barrymore teamed again in Rasputin and the Empress. Joining them in a sumptuous and stirring tale about the often-called Mad Monk who held a powerful perhaps hypnotic sway over World War I-era Russian royalty was the third member of the American stages Royal Family: Ethel Barrymore, making this the lone feature with all three thespian siblings. Intercut with footage from the actual era, the film burns with intrigue, betrayal, rivalry and the renowned trios talents. Lionel has the plum role of Rasputin, seething with ambition and rage. I will be Russia! he proclaims. History shows he would not. But this movie shows he would not be forgotten.

Sassy and ambitious waitress Mary Evans (Constance Bennett) amuses and befriends seldom-sober director Max Carey (Lowell Sherman), who stumbles into her restaurant. Max invites Mary to his film premiere and, after a night of drinking and carousing, Mary charms her way into a screen test and then a contract with a movie studio. Just as Mary finds her dreams coming true and her career on the upswing, Cary's life and career begins its descent.

A seldom-seen gem from the oeuvre of famed film director George Cukor, What Price Hollywood? Takes a shrewd, playful and pragmatic view of cinematic life from the other side of the camera, and created the blueprint from which all other ""true-life Hollywood tell-alls"" have been created, including A Star Is Born, in the 1954 version of which Cukor directed Judy Garland.

When an astrologer tells Vicky she'll meet her dream man in two weeks, the neglected wife greets the news with eager anticipation. Bill scoffs -- until a handsome air raid warden (James Craig) shows about just before midnight on day 14! After proving themselves a powerful dramatic team in the thriller Crossroads, William Powell and Hedy Lamarr reunite for a sparkling romantic comedy spiced with slapstick that includes Powell's wobble-legged ballet when teetotaler Whitley tries vodka...by the case.

Heads: He wins. Tails: You lose. Joe Adams doesn't play the odds. He makes them. Who would think Cupid would turn the odds against him? With roguish charm and dialogue spiked with Cockney rhyming slang, Cary Grant portrays Joe in a wartime romantic comedy from the director of Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. Luck is on Joe's side when he dodges the draft by taking another man's 4-F status. And he seems to hold all aces when he worms his way into a war relief group and plans to pocket its funds. But larceny gives way to love. Joe finds he's in deep with a winsome charity worker (Laraine Day). And that puts him in deep, deep trouble with fellow con artists. Lucky at cards, unlucky in love? Say it ain't so, Joe!

Directed By H.C. Potter

A haunting sequel to Cat People (1942) co-directed by Robert Wise (The Haunting, The Sound of Music) in which Amy, the young daughter of Irena (Simon Simon) and Oliver (Kent Smith), is a very imaginative child who is unable to differentiate fantasy from reality, and has no friends of her own age. Amy makes an imaginary friend through the ghost of her father's dead first wife, Irena, and befriends Julia Farren (Julia Dean), an aging, reclusive actress who is also alienated from her own daughter. This sequel, produced by the great Val Lewton, is widely regarded as 'the best movie about horror movies and why grown-ups watch them'.

Here's the speech, I'm pretty sure it's word for word and the film version:

What's he that wishes so? 
My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin: 
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow 
To do our country loss; and if to live, 
The fewer men, the greater share of honour. 
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more. 
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host, 
That he which hath no stomach to this fight, 
Let him depart; his passport shall be made 
And crowns for convoy put into his purse: 
We would not die in that man's company 
That fears his fellowship to die with us. 

This day is called the feast of Crispian: 
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, 
Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named, 
And rouse him at the name of Crispian. 
He that shall live this day, and see old age, 
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, 
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:' 
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars. 
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.' 
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot, 
But he'll remember with advantages 
What feats he did that day: then shall our names. 
Familiar in his mouth as household words 
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter, 
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester, 
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd. 
This story shall the good man teach his son; 
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by, 
From this day to the ending of the world, 
But we in it shall be remember'd; 
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; 
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me 
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, 
This day shall gentle his condition: 
And gentlemen in England now a-bed 
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here, 
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks 
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.",725755,2090,600,PT2M15S,0

It won Stothart his only Oscar.

It's 1912 and Greece is beset by war and pestilence. As his troops bury their dead after another bloody battle, stern General Pherides (Boris Karloff) goes to visit the grave of his wife, buried on an island nearby. He's horrified to see her tomb has been looted and learns grave robbers are to blame for the desecration but there is worse news to come: plague has come to the island.

 
The doctors are powerless but perhaps the sickness has another cause. Could it be that a 'Vorvolaka' - a vampiric demon - is at large on the island? And is there anything that can stop it?

And so amid the women’s mounting anxiety commences a series of flashbacks, each telling the story of how the three individual marriages had come in their own way to be so strained at the present...

A spectacular success at the time of its release, A Letter to Three Wives was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and earned Mankiewicz the Academy Awards for both Best Director and Best Screenplay.

Enormously popular child actress Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me in St. Louis) touches the heart in this classic adventure of a young orphan sent to live at the dark and foreboding English estate of her widowed uncle and his crippled son, played by fellow child sensation Dean Stockwell. Led by a strong will and a stubborn temperament, Mary Lennox (O'Brien) discovers the existence of a secret garden, the history of which slowly reveals the mystery of her uncle and his son's embittered lives. Eventually, the beloved garden becomes the only hope for their happiness and restoration from the haunting grip of the past. Produced by Clarence Brown, the film is based on the popular novel by acclaimed children's author Frances Hodgson Burnett (Little Lord Fauntleroy). A dazzling technical effect aptly derived from The Wizard of Oz brings the secret garden alive in a radiant color sequence, making it, and the film, a magical place you'll have to experience yourself!

5479,hr1h1acceRs,Los Olvidados (1950) -  Luis Buñuel,"Review of Luis Buñuel's 1950 Mexican classic, Los Olvidados (The Forgotten Ones or The Young and the Damned).  
https://www.themetropolistimes.com/the-metropolis-times/2011/05/15/bunuel-real-and-surreal

Los Olvidados - billed in English as The Young and the Damned - was directed by legendary filmmaker Luis Buñuel. In 1950, he was best known for his surrealist works like Un chien andalou and L'Âge d'Or. However, Land Without Bread, Buñuel's 1933 parody of ethnographic documentaries, showed he knew how to handle a more realistic style.
(Land without Bread: https://www.themetropolistimes.com/the-metropolis-times/2010/07/15/land-without-bread-the-original-borat )

Los Olvidados lies more closely to social realism than surrealism. The story is pretty standard for the genre. Impoverished boys in Mexico City turn to crime. Pedro becomes an accomplice to murder and the social order attempts to reform him. Buñuel, of course, was less than committed to realism. The narrative breaks for Pedro to have a dream sequence, and the boy throws an egg at the camera late in the film.

Buñuel saw surrealism as in some ways more accurate than standard realism. It certainly doesn't make the film any less harsh. Like most of his movies, Los Olvidados was unpopular with the government, which was trying to portray Mexico as an enlightened, progressive state.",94243,94,6,PT1M39S,0

Throw in Russell as ""Mike"", the luscious head of a gang of thieves, and Roy Rogers as a federal marshal hot on her trail.

5486,DAwhQRDSzBk,GATE OF HELL Clip (Masters of Cinema),"""It is hard to convey in simple language the moving qualities of this lovely film"" -- New York Times

One of the key works of the early 1950s wave of Japanese films to first reach foreign markets, director Kinugasa's sumptuous period drama astonished audiences with its dramatic force and spectacular colour cinematography.

During feudal unrest in the 12th century, samurai warrior Moritō (Kazuo Hasegawa) manages to thwart a palace rebellion and save the life of the empress, using loyal subject Lady Kesa (Machiko Kyō) as a decoy. When Moritō is offered anything he should desire as reward, he requests Kesa's hand in marriage. Informed that she is already married to a fellow samurai (Isao Yamagata), he refuses to withdraw his request, setting in motion a tragic chain of events.

Three decades after the director's iconic A Page of Madness, Kinugasa's striking tale of feudal intrigue, political machinations, and erotic obsession won the Grand Prix at Cannes, two Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Costume Design, and has since been named by Martin Scorsese as one of the ten greatest colour achievements in world cinema. Gate of Hell's blazing palette is proudly presented afresh by The Masters of Cinema Series in a magnificent new restoration, available for the very first time for home viewing in the UK, released in a Dual Format (DVD & Blu-ray) & DVD edition on 3 December 2012.

5488,#NAME?,"The Long, Long Trailer - Trailer","Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz live slaphappily ever after as newlyweds honeymooning in The Long, Long Trailer, breezily directed by Vincente Minnelli. They quickly find that the interior of a moving trailer is ideal for tossing a Caesar salad - and everything else. That backing up their 40-foot, three-ton home is only a little more difficult than threading a needle wearing boxing gloves. And that trailer-park folks are neighborly sorts who turn the lovebirds' rig into the wrong, wrong trailer by crashing the wedding night.

Co-starring comedy pros Marjorie Main and Keenan Wynn (Ball's frequent co-star in her MGM days), this smash was filmed at the height of the I Love Lucy craze and is packed with the inventive sight gags and physical humor that made the series a TV landmark.

Everybody knows this infamous line from the movie 'On the Waterfront' - a propaganda movie about corrupt union bosses that Hollywood gladly made. But not too many folks know about 'Salt of the Earth' - a movie whose makers were blacklisted and terrorized by the U.S. government, major Hollywood studios, and other criminals. You thought Michael Moore had it bad having to deal with death threats? Nothing taken away from Moore's efforts, but the makers of this simple movie were terrorized far worse.

From the Wiki page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_of_the_Earth):

Salt of the Earth is a 1954 film which tells the story of a long, difficult strike by Mexican-American miners against the Empire Zinc Company in Bayard (near Silver City), New Mexico in 1950-1951 (In the film, the events were set in the fictional village of ""Zinc Town""). The issues were equity in wages with Anglo workers, safety, and health. The film stars Rosaura Revueltas, Will Geer, David Wolfe, Mervin Williams, David Sarvis, Juan Chacón, Henrietta Williams and Ernesto Velázquez; many of the miners and their families had parts in the film.

Written, directed by and starring Orson Welles, Confidential Report is a controversial and highly individual thriller with a deliciously cruel twist. Gregory Arkadin (Orson Welles) is one of the world's most powerful financiers, a giant of a man whose ruthless grasp spans entire continents. But Gregory Arkadin is also an amnesiac -- and he has no idea what terrible secrets may be lurking in his forgotten past. Arkadin hires petty crook Guy Van Stratten (Robert Arden) to investigate his life and to prepare a confidential report. Van Stratten scours Europe in search of answers, but no-one is prepared for what he will uncover -- and the effect it will have on Arkadin's beautiful young daughter (Paola Mori). Also known as 'Mr Arkadin', Confidential Report is a fascinating companion piece to Welles' most celebrated film Citizen Kane, and filmed in a brilliant mix of Noir and contemporary European styles. The film has been restored and remastered for this, its first ever UK DVD release.

Following the 1967 success of Bonnie and Clyde, American International Pictures rereleased the film as a double feature with The Bonnie Parker Story.

The film starts by showing a bank robbery orchestrated by Kelly and other partners, including his love interest. It then examines Kelly's personality and events that lead to discord among his group. A botched bank robbery causes one of his partners, Michael Fandango, portrayed by typical jokester Morey Amsterdam, to lose an arm.

During the era of Prohibition, gangsters gained enormous power by controlling the illicit drink. The most infamous was a thug from Brooklyn who murdered his way to the top and was, for a time, one of the most powerful men in the United States. In this unusually accurate biography, small-time hood Al Capone (Rod Steiger) comes to Chicago at the dawn of Prohibition to be the bodyguard of racketeer Johnny Torrio. Capone's rise in Chicago gangdom is followed through murder, extortion, and political fraud. He becomes head of Chicago's biggest ""business,"" but moves inexorably toward his downfall and ignominious end.

He led America's battles against the Depression and the Axis powers -- and won. But first Franklin Delano Roosevelt fought a personal battle against polio that would either destroy him -- or arm him for greatness. This powerful film of Dore Schary's long-running play is an intimate, admiring profile in courage. Ralph Bellamy reprises his dynamic, Tony-winning stage portrayal of the future President and Greer Garson is his devoted, warbly-voiced wife Eleanor. Both are uncannily true in their roles and acclaim followed: Garson earned Golden Globe and National Board of Review Best Actress Awards as well as one of the movie's four Oscar nominations.* With exteriors filmed at Campobello and Hyde Park and interiors staged on uncanny duplications of the real-life Roosevelt homes, Sunrise at Campobello shines eloquently and movingly.

Book tickets here: http://miff.com.au/program/film/5818

""[The Easy Life] sounds like any old odd-couple comedy; its collected talent and social seismography make it anything but ... The model for a dozen Discover America road trips, from New Hollywood to Alexander Payne, Risi's film is also the most unassuming sort of masterpiece."" -- Village Voice

One of the acknowledged masters of commedia all'italiana, Dino Risi reached his artistic peak with The Easy Life. The comedic blueprint for the modern road-trip movie, Risi's film has still rarely been surpassed, a tour de force of personal insight and social commentary that captured the anxiety and aspiration of a booming Italy.

Timid law student Roberto's (Jean-Louis Trintignant) life is turned upside down when he accepts a car ride from carefree, wealthy braggart Bruno (Vittorio Gassman). Over two days the men drink and cruise the Italian coastline, getting into bizarre scrapes and urging each other on to greater, ever more dangerous feats. Also starring Catherine Spaak, The Easy Life ""gives a glorious taste of Italy on a summer day a half-century ago."" -- Seattle Times

5534,LZ4TVr_FVTg,Original Theatrical Trailer | The Prize | Warner Archive,"The Prize (1963) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #ThePrize

This long clamored for Cold War thriller finds it way to disc at last. Unexpectedly winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, closet crime novelist Andrew Craig (Paul Newman) finds himself swept up into Cold War intrigue while attempting to accept the award. More comfortable at the bar than at the abacus, affable souse Craig nonetheless sniffs a whiff of wrongdoing when Dr. Max Stratman (Edward G. Robinson), winner of the physics prize, undergoes a mysterious personality change. Co-starring Elke Sommer with Jerry Goldsmith contributing a masterful score, and a screenplay penned by North by Northwest scribe Ernest Lehman, The Prize is a truly Hitchcockian thriller with fully realized characters, sweeping surprises and danger filled denouement.

Directed By Mark Robson
Starring Paul Newman, Edward G. Robinson, Elke Sommer

Under Torrey's command, the tiny fleet of a dozen ships carries out its orders to seek out and engage the enemy fleet. But lack of fuel and a daring maneuver causes his ship to be seriously damaged. He's relieved of command and assigned to a desk job routing convoys in the shakeup following the attack, and his exec and oldest friend, Commander Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas), is reassigned after a brawl, the result of his anger after identifying the body of his wife (Barbara Bouchet) who was killed during the attack while cavorting with an Marine Corps officer. Torrey's begins a romantic relationship with Lt. Maggie Haines (Patricia Neal), a navy nurse. Torrey learns of a top-secret offensive called Sky Hook — he figures out enough of it to impress Powell, and when Sky Hook gets bogged down by the indecisiveness of its commander, Powell convinces the commander of the Pacific Fleet (Adm. Chester Nimitz) that Torrey is the man to salvage the operation.",201156,561,91,PT4M57S,0

When acclaimed documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker (MONTEREY POP, THE WAR ROOM) filmed Bob Dylan during a three-week concert tour of England in the Spring of 1965, he had no idea he was about to create one of the most intimate glimpses of the rock legend ever put on film. Wanting make more than just a concert film, Pennebaker decided to seek out both the public and private Bob Dylan. 

With unobtrusive equipment and unlimited access, Pennebaker achieved an unprecedented, fly-on-the-wall glimpse of one of music's most influential figures - and redefined filmmaking along the way. Hailed as one of the best films about a performing artist ever created, DONT LOOK BACK is more than a view into an extraordinary concert tour - Dylan's last as an acoustic performer. It is a window into the spirit of the 60s, and one of the poet-musicians whose words and songs defined it.",582137,1036,91,PT2M18S,0

Director: Eric Rohmer
Writer: Eric Rohmer
Stars: Jean-Claude Brialy, Aurora Cornu, Béatrice Romand...
(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065772/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm)

Summary:
The fifth of Eric Rohmer's ""Six Moral Tales,"" Claire's Knee is a deliciously Rohmeresque story of sexual obsession. French diplomat Jerome (Jean-Claude Brialy), on a resort vacation, meets Claire (Laurence De Monaghan), the teen-aged daughter of a friend. Though engaged to be married, Jerome falls hopelessly in love -- not with Claire, but with Claire's knee. Realizing that to be revealed as a fetishist would be ruinous for him, Jerome does not act upon his obsession. Eventually he gets to fulfill his yearnings by placing his hand upon Claire's knee, a gesture which she assumes is out of sympathy for a personal crisis she is going through. Originally released as Le Genou de Claire, this film was the recipient of the Prix Louis Delluc and the Prix Melies. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi

Beautifully shot by Wolfgang Suzchitzky with a memorably contrapuntal romantic score by Michael J. Lewis, nuanced direction by Douglas Hickcox and a wittily literate script by Anthony Greville-Bell. Similar to Price's Dr. Phibes murder sprees, but far less cartoony and more emotionally affecting. Apologies for the poor quality of this trailer (with Danish subtitles yet) but it's the only one we could find in the correct ratio with the narration intact.

Lots of hat-tips to Conan Doyle throughout for devout Holmes fans, but it's a sublimely silly movie on its own. Albert Finney has a cameo dissing opera singers.

Barbet Schroeder's Maîtresse (1976), starring a youthful Gérard Depardieu and Bulle Ogier as leather-clad dominatrix Ariane, caused controversy with its graphic scenes of torture and fetishism. Originally confined to a handful of club cinemas upon its release, it was then given an 'X' certificate in 1981 after the BBFC requested a number of cuts. Released in a Dual Format Edition on 5 November 2012 by the BFI and presented uncut on DVD and, for the first time, on Blu-ray, Maîtresse is a stylish love story -- costumes are by Karl Lagerfeld -- with a dark undertone.

Available from Amazon: http://amzn.to/PKmqzZ

The release coincides with Uncut, a season at BFI Southbank that marks the centenary of the BBFC, which runs from 1 -- 30 November.

Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor buy a first class ticket to comedy and murder.

The most hilarious suspense ride of your life!

In this wild comedy adventure, rail passenger George Caldwell (Gene Wilder) finds that a romantic escapade with a sultry secretary (Jill Clayburgh) puts him in the middle of a Hitchcockian murder plot. Leaping on and off the train, in and out of roomettes, bars and dining cars, George teams up with an amiable, small-time crook (Richard Pryor) to defy the murderer's henchmen, FBI agents and a host of other outrageous characters.

DukeBoyO1's 2 cents: This is a great movie which I have watched several times already in the last two day's that I've seen it (I found the DVD in our DVD rack), made 3/4th's a music video, and am putting the movie on my DS. =) But remember.. Nothing can stop, Silver Streak.

Who stole $250 million in Nazi gold? And who killed General George S. Patton to get away with it? A chilling suspense thriller, Brass Target makes the convincing case that these two actual events -- the theft of the bullion and Patton's death (""officially"" killed in an auto accident) -- were not coincidental. Was Patton assassinated? Grisly fact or engrossing fiction?

The all-star ""top brass"" cast includes Sophia Loren as a mysterious refugee, John Cassavetes as Maj. Joe De Luca, George Kennedy as Patton, Robert Vaughn as the mastermind behind the plot and Max von Sydow as a cold-blooded assassin. Based on an intriguing book by Frederick Nolan, Brass Target is ""a classy conspiracy thriller with one of those great blood-and-guts plots"" (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times). Brass Target takes aim and hits the mark for action-packed suspense.

Directed By John Hough
Starring Sophia Loren, John Cassavetes, Max von Sydow

Rockers is a 1978 Jamaican film by Ted Bafaloukos. Several popular reggae artists star in the movie, including Leroy ""Horsemouth"" Wallace, Burning Spear, Gregory Isaacs, Big Youth, Dillinger, and Jacob Miller.

Rockers was originally to be a documentary but blossomed into a full-length feature showing the reggae culture at its peak.

In this film, the culture, characters and mannerisms are authentic. The main rocker Leroy ""Horsemouth"" Wallace, for example, is shown living with his actual wife and kids and in his own home. The recording studios shown are the famous Harry J Studios where many roots reggae artists recorded during the 70s including Bob Marley. Samples of the film's dialogue were used in the early 1990's jungle track, ""Babylon"" by Splash.

This lyrical adaptation of the beloved Japanese novel by Junichiro Tanizaki was a late-career triumph for world-class director Kon Ichikawa. Revolving around the changing of the seasons, The Makioka Sisters (Sasame-yuki) follows the lives of four sisters who have taken on their family's kimono manufacturing business, over the course of a number of years leading up to the Pacific War. The two oldest have been married for some time, but according to tradition, the rebellious youngest sister cannot wed until the third, conservative and terribly shy, finds a husband. This graceful study of a family at a turning point in history is a poignant evocation of changing times and fading customs, shot in rich, vivid colors.",55139,253,17,PT2M14S,0

England, 1931. A time of innocence and education, of hope and unity. Two teenagers establish a life-changing friendship at an elite public school and soon discover the omnipotent pressures that surround them to be equally energising as alienating.

Within the closed atmosphere of school, Guy Bennett (Rupert Everett, My Best Friends Wedding) and Tommy Judd (Colin Firth, The King's Speech) explore their options and bravely set out to establish a set of ideals to aspire to. Clever, flamboyant and gay, Guy is optimistic and stoic in his pursuit of a career in the diplomatic service. Conversely Tommy takes an alternative path towards Socialism, despising his friend's fancy-footed bourgeois dreams.

Setelah Police Story (Ging chat goo si 1-1985) dan Police Story 2 (Ging chaat goo si 2 - 1988) yang kedua duanya disutradarai oleh Jackie Chan, Supercop (Ging chat goo si 3: Chiu kup ging chat - 1992) dan Jackie Chan's First Strike (Ging chaat goo si 4: Ji gaan daan yam mo - 1996) yang keduanya disutradarai oleh Stanley Tong, serta film terakhir New Police Story (Xin jing cha gu shi - 2004) yang disutradarai oleh  Benny Chan, maka di film Police Story 2013 ini Jackie Chan menggandeng sutradara Sheng Ding.

Sesuai judulnya maka kisahnya pun bercerita tentang seorang polisi (interpol), hanya kali ini setting cerita bukan lagi di hongkong tapi di mainland China. Alkisah seorang polisi bernama Zhong Wen (Jackie Chan) yang telah 20 tahun lebih bertugas menumpas kejahatan. Kesibukannya menjadi seorang polisi yang baik membuat dia tidak terlalu berhasil dalam kehidupan pribadinya, terlebih hubunganya dengan anaknya miao miao (Jing Tian), sampai akhirnya tanpa diketahuinya anaknya berhubungan dengan seorang pria bernama Wu Jiang ( Liu Ye) yang ternyata adalah teman dari salah seorang penjahat yang pernah dijebloskan oleh Zhong ke dalam penjara karena kasus pembunuhan.

Synopsis:
Ning Caichen (Leslie Cheung) is a lowly tax collector who takes refuge for the night at the spooky Lam Ro temple. There he encounters and promptly falls in love with a beautiful ghost named Nie Xiaoqian (Joey Wang). Unfortunately Xiaoqian is damned to serve the evil hermaphroditic tree spirit Lao Lao, who (thanks to an extraordinarily long tongue) feasts on the souls of amorous young males. Usually Xiaoqian, along with her comely sister Qing, tempts would-be Lotharios to their arboreal doom, but she too is smitten with the downtrodden wanderer. Soon afterwards, Caichen meets Master Yan (Ma Wu), a Taoist hermit, martial arts master, and a sworn enemy of Lao Lao, who tells him of Xiaoqian's true, otherworldly nature. Nonetheless, true love proves to be strong. Caichen promises Xiaoqian that he will help spring her from her dubious employment and Xiaoqian protects her love from the evil wood sprite. Later, things grow more complicated for the lovers when they learn that Xiaoqian has been betrothed to a demon warlord. ~AllRovi.com",131913,284,31,PT1M42S,0

5743,elNCMX8EzAM,Monsieur Hire (DVD Trailer),"http://www.kino.com/video/item.php?film_id=886
Touching, lyrical, erotic, suspenseful and enigmatic, Patrice Leconte¹s (Girl on the Bridge) 1989 psychological drama Monsieur Hire is both ""a twisted love story and a tragic thriller"" (London Sunday Times). In a provincial French apartment block, Monsieur Hire (Michel Blanc) endures a solitary life of dulling work as a tailor and vitriolic scorn from his neighbors. Hire¹s only solace is an occasional night out bowling and the voyeuristic admiration of his neighbor, the ""ravishingly erotic"" (Entertainment Weekly) Alice (Sandrine Bonnaire ­ Vagabond, À Nos Amours), a beautiful, free-spirited woman conducting a heated love affair through un-drawn curtains across the way. But when police discover the nude body of another young woman in a nearby vacant lot, Hire becomes the prime suspect in a murder investigation that brings him face to face with the object of his desire even as it threatens to ensnare them both in a web of deceit, accusation, lust, and guilt.

Adapted from the book by celebrated Belgian crime novelist Georges Simenon, Monsieur Hire is a film of gorgeously muted widescreen color and ""funereal beauty"" (The Washington Post) that coolly unpacks sexual obsession and romantic love with an intelligence and understated intensity ""so delicate that you almost hold your breath for the last half-hour"" (Roger Ebert).",131627,185,19,PT2M1S,0

From acclaimed filmmaker and raconteur extraordinaire David Mamet (Heist) comes a provocative and gripping thriller about murder, loyalty and identity. Bobby Gold (Joe Mantegna, Criminal Minds) is a tough yet devoted cop who is thrust into the otherwise routine murder investigation of an elderly Jewish shopkeeper. What seems a straightforward case soon unravels to become a bewildering urban odyssey of intrigue and conspiracy as an underground movement of Zionist vigilantism and anti-Jewish activity threatens to unhinge Gold's own ideas of morality. The more involved he becomes in the case the more his judgment is clouded, bringing into question his loyalty to partner Sullivan (William H. Macy, Fargo). Also featuring Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction) and Rebecca Pidgeon (The Winslow Boy) Homicide is a taut, thought-provoking look at the underbelly of a ruthless and unforgiving world.",32603,113,10,PT2M13S,0

During periods of exacerbation of this disease, the patient considers himself a murderer of Alexander II and Nicholas II, Emperors of Russia.

Smirnov’s predecessor believed that “there are things in the human mind that are better never to be touched,” but the new doctor advocates a different treatment.

When his master is killed during the Japanese occupation of China, he returns to avenge his teacher's death. Back in China, he finds himself caught in the escalating racial tensions between the Chinese and the Japanese. The martial arts sequences in this 1994 film are handled more seriously than flashy acrobatics of other kung fu epics of the time and are perhaps a better showcase for Li's awe-inspiring fighting abilities. This story is inspired heavily by Bruce Lee's classic Fists of Fury.

In his dreams and daydreams he sees his father in a car crash, his brother abducted, and his own classmates shot at by men in white masks. His peers tease him, or simply ignore him. Even Nicolas' teachers are frustrated by his lack of social skills. His paranoid father is of little help. Nicolas disconnects from the world around him, inhabiting his own friendless, nightmarish realm.

On a class trip to the ski country, Hadkann, the class bully, befriends Nicolas and becomes intrigued by his dreams. When Nicolas takes ill, his visions become more intense. The line between reality and hallucination blurs as his startling visions begin to come true. When police find a dead child in the woods, murdered and mutilated, Nicolas knows there is a connection between this crime and his visions, and with Hadkann's help, he sets out to find it.

Claude Miller directs CLASS TRIP with a deft and subtle hand. Adapted from Emmanuel Carrere's acclaimed novel of the same name, Miller takes his audience inside the mind of an emotionally damaged child. He recalls the intense social hierarchy of childhood, combining it with the psychological suspense of an unseen killer, and the haunting beauty of the French countryside. His previous works include ALIAS BETTY and LA PETITE LILI.

Eine apokalyptische Komödie, schnell, grotesk, respektlos und intelligent: Wie aus dem Nichts taucht ein seltsamer Unbekannter in London auf. Wo immer er hinkommt, häufen sich groteske und mysteriöse Vorfälle, bis die Stadt im absurden Chaos zu versinken droht. Es ist der Tag der Sonnenfinsternis.

Eine apokalyptische Komödie von Ben Hopkins

The Nine Lives Of Tomas Katz
84 minutes, 
UK/Germany (2000), 
The second feature from British writer-director Ben Hopkins, this is a apocalyptic black comedy. Erratically executed, it still exudes eccentric inventiveness On the day of a solar eclipse, stranger Tomas Katz (the hugely versatile Fisher) materializes from a man-hole at the edge of the M25. Inexplicable powers enable this bizarrely-dressed individual to take on the identities of people he comes into contact with, and in these different guises - taxi-driver, government minister, London Underground controller, security guard - he wreaks havoc on a fast-disappearing metropolis.

Suddenly the Tube trains are carrying the souls of the dead to the Valley of Judgement, whilst the country has declared war on an obscure Pacific island. Only the mystical and blind Chief of the Metropolitan Police (McNeice) can foil Katz and prevent the end of the world by finding the legendary astral child.

The highly improvised The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz draws on a whole range of references and influences, including Monty Python, German expressionism, 'The Day Today', MTV pop videos, and Derek Jarman. Handsomely shot in black and white, there's evidence here of a fertile cinematic imagination on the part of Hopkins (whose previous feature, Simon Magus, was similarly shot through with the uncanny), enabling the spectator to view (and hear) London from a fresh perspective.

However, there's also a significant downside to the freewheeling style in the form of erratic pacing, ramshackle structure and woolly ideas, which result in the film becoming irritating, at times little more than a series of surreal set-pieces. The fact that the credits include a dedication to ""the bollards and windows of London"", gives some indication of the off-the-wall nature of the whole enterprise.",5779,45,4,PT1H24M41S,0

German historian and member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Klaus Muller interviews the dozen or so surviving victims, now frail and wizened, who recount their experiences. Jewish resistance fighter Gad Beck recalls how he posed as a Hitler Youth in an ultimately vain attempt at saving his lover. One man was freed from a sentence at Dachau only to be interned again a Buchenwald. Another recalls hearing, in the distance, a 'singing forest' -- the sound of gays bound and tortured by Nazis in a local grove.

Mini-serie para televisión, que adapta la famosa novela de Marion Zimmer Bradley sobre las leyendas artúricas. En ella se muestra cómo la vida del mítico rey Arturo estuvo siempre marcada por diferentes mujeres que le marcaron desde su infancia, siendo su tía, gran sacerdotisa de la isla de Avalon, el reino de las hadas. Este hecho marcaría su destino. Su tia Viviane, Gran Sacerdotisa de la isla de Avalón, dónde nació la antigüa religión de la Madre Diosa, decidió su nacimiento, su formación y, sin pretenderlo, su destino final. Su otra tía, Morgause, realizó un conjuro para que la reina fuera estéril. Su esposa Ginebra, enamorada de Lancelot, su mejor amigo, vivió atormentada por no darle un descendiente y, finalmente, su medio hermana Morgana, la mujer que más le amó, fue entregada en sacrificio al propio Rey para que engendrara de él un hijo sano y fuerte, aunque después, cuando descubrió quién fue su fugaz amante, nunca le reveló su secreto.
Hans Matheson aparece interpretando el papel de ""Mordred Pendragón"", hijo de Morgana y Arturo Pendragón, directo descendiente Pendragón para reinar Avalon a la muerte de su padre.",158416,405,13,PT44S,0

Directed by Jerzy Stuhr
SCREENPLAY BY KRZYSZTOF KIESLOWSKI 
Featuring Jerzy Stuhr, Anna Dymna, Rubio the camel

""When the camel lolls his jaws at dinnertime, or sways his Bactrian bulk, you may decide you've never seen anything quite so hilarious - or magnificent.""  
— New York Magazine

The Big Animal (Duze Zwierze), scripted by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski and shot in shimmering black-and-white by cinematographer Pawel Edelman (Academy Award nominee for Roman Polanski's The Pianist) is a lovely, small film that exposes greed and pettiness while celebrating the most beautiful human themes:  love, friendship and tolerance.

AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE FILM FESTIVAL 2000
NOMINEE, GRAND JURY PRIZE

READ MORE...

When the circus leaves town, Zygmunt Sawicki and his wife Marysia unwittingly adopt a camel into their family. The couple quickly forms a close bond with the nameless camel. At first the townspeople, too, are enthralled with the giant animal, since it is a welcome distraction from their everyday routine. As the bond between the couple and their camel grows stronger, the town-people suddenly begin to ostracize them...

Renowned filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (The Decalogue, Three Colors Trilogy) wrote the screenplay (based on the novel, Wielblad, by Kazimierz Orlos) in the 1970s, at the height of political oppression and social upheaval during the Communist era. This hothouse environment cultivated Poland's Cinema of Moral Anxiety and subversive criticism through the arts when it was difficult to speak openly. Mr. Kieslowki's friend Elzbieta Scotti safeguarded the script of The Big Animal.  After his death, he returned it to his widow.

SELECTED REVIEWS

""Mr. Stuhr, an actor who worked frequently with Kieslowski and who plays the main character in this film, honors his old friend's memory, producing a minor but nonetheless charming footnote to his oeuvre.""   — The New York Times

""The Big Animal is also a gift from the great beyond:  working from a recently-discovered, unfinished 1973 screenplay by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski, vet Polish actor-helmer Jerzy Stuhr...has made a rueful yet gentle fable about the price of individuality and the value of dignity... and will appeal to anyone old enough to read the subtitles."" — Variety

""An actor-turned-director, Stuhr appeared in many of Kieslowski's films and their partnership and friendship produced some stunning work. The Big Animal memorializes a complex man and his deceptively simple work, by a friend and colleague in a fitting tribute.""  —  Chicago Tribune 

""Gathers a sort of darkness as it comes to its oblique conclusion.""  — Boston Globe

""It is whimsical, bittersweet, wise in a minor key.""  — Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times

""This black-and-white movie features an enduring image: an ordinary couple at the dinner table with the giant, Dr. Seuss-like head of the camel ­filling their window ominously, ridiculously, like another dinner guest -- or like the proverbial elephant in the room that no one will address.""  — New York Daily News 

""The tale's faux-fable simplicity is cunningly eloquent.""  — Village Voice

It's back in 52 BC. That's right, BC. Although Gaul isn't totally overrun, Cleopatra's Egypt is under the yoke of the Roman Empire. What's worse is that Cleopatra, that dame with the big nose, has had the good sense to chose Caesar for her boyfriend. Caesar is the Emperor of the Greatest of All Peoples. Or so he says.

Bei is a less-than-successful exercise equipment salesman who yearns for excitement in his life. One day, Bei follows his instincts and trails two-suspicious-looking men into action and foils their plans. The resulting publicity from Bei's heroism brings him to the attention of a private investigator who informs him that he is actually the long-lost son of a wealthy businessman. Hoping to reunite with his true family, Bei travels to Korea where his father lies dying. Bei finds, to his astonishment, that both his parents lived the life he has longed for himself: they were both professional spies. Drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse where no one can be trusted, Bei travels to Turkey, where soon it's up to him to track down a new, highly addictive narcotic before it ends up in the hands of evil drug lords.

At first glance a souped-up Halloween haunted house, Hell Houses are modern-day fire-and-brimstone sermons replete with hundreds of actors, truck loads of lights and full audio-visual tech crews. In each room, visitors view depictions of school massacres, AIDS deaths, fatal drunk driving crashes, and botched abortions while demons goad the gullible sinners into doing their bidding and then cart their souls off to hell. With full access to the behind-the-scenes action, Hell House follows the process from the first script meeting until the last of the 13,000 visitors passes through the Hell House doors. The movie gives a window into the whole outrageous process of creating this over-the-top sermon, while showing an intimate portrait of the people who haunt this peculiar culture.",107897,222,38,PT1M48S,0

Eichhorn, Buk provided me with poems to interpret. He endorsed and cashed every check. Most importantly, to me, he liked the comics, let me do another, etc. A few panels of our comics are shown in the movie. They are flashed by quickly in the trailer, but the drinking cartoons are from the comic book title called BIG MOUTH. Some of these books are still available here

6016,mvpiDdTVWec,Moon Child,"In the year 2014, Japan suffers a major economic collapse and people are forced to emigrate to mainland China. Three orphaned boys live in a fictional Chinese city called Mallepa, a 'melting pot' of different Asian groups. They are named Sho (Gackt), Shinji (Susumu Terajima) who is Sho's brother, and Toshi (Tarô Yamamoto). All three survive through pickpocketing. During a theft gone wrong, Sho meets Kei (Hyde), a young looking man who is actually a vampire.

Several years later, Sho is in his twenties, leading a gang together with Kei and Toshi. During one of the robberies against another gang, they cross paths with a Taiwanese named Son (Leehom). Son is going after the gang because their leader raped his sister, Yi-Che (Zeny Kwok). Sho, Kei, Son and Toshi all become friends, and Sho quickly and awkwardly falls in love with Yi-Che. Toshi is murdered by the local mafia for helping Sho and Kei by using poisoned pizza to sedate their targets. Soon, through this experience, Son and Yi-Che learn that Kei is a vampire.

Nine years later, Sho is head of his district in Mallepa and is married to Yi-Che. Son has joined Mr. Chan, the leader of the mafia of Mallepa and is now Sho's enemy.

Yi-Che develops a fatal cancerous brain tumor. Soon after the diagnosis, Sho's men are killed on the streets in broad daylight while Sho is away. Sho's brother, Shinji, is also killed when he points at gun at Mr. Chan while in a drug induced haze. Sho calls Kei, who he had discovered was being held by police and had visited once before, begging him to return. After speaking to Kei he is told that Kei had been sentenced to death, something Kei had actually requested. Kei, however, escapes his execution and returns. Sho asks Kei to turn Yi-Che into a vampire so she will be around for the sake of Hana (their young daughter). Kei refuses angrily, but agrees to face Mr. Chan with Sho. He promises Sho that if anything happens to him, he will take care of Hana.

When they go to face Mr. Chan, Mr. Chan is shot by two of his own while Sho faces off with Son. Their battle comes down to a 'count to three and shoot' match when they are both down to only one bullet. Sho's gun misfires and he is shot in the chest by Son. Kei arrives on the scene and Son faces his own death by pointing his empty gun at Kei, who is enraged at the sight of his injured friend and fires at Son. Kei goes to Sho, who appears to die dramatically in Kei's arms.

In 2045, Hana is grown up and heading off to college. She says goodbye to Kei, who raised her in Sho's absence and it is implied that she is aware of Kei being a vampire. Before she leaves she mentions the feeling of someone watching her, and after her departure Sho appears as a vampire, thanking Kei for taking care of her all these years because he couldn't face what he had become. Together the two men drive to the beach and await the rising sun together to face death. The movie concludes with the entire gang back together at the beach in the daylight (something not possible for Kei in the past), presumably reunited in the afterlife or as reincarnations of themselves in another life.",256488,3365,0,PT1H59M53S,0

Nómadas, amor y terapia musical en un paraiso natural

El cine nos ha dejado a lo largo de su historia documentos que son un reflejo de nuestra vida humana y han sido realizados con una especial sensibilidad como lo demostró Robert Flaherty con su film etnográfico Nanuk el esquimal (1920-1922). En este aparentemente explorado planeta todavía hay muchos pueblos que conservan costumbres y tradiciones que se escapan del inventario del patrimonio cultural de la humanidad. Este es el caso de los pueblos nómadas que pululan por las estepas y desiertos de Mongolia. La historia del camello que llora explora los destinos de una familia de nómadas mongoleses y de los animales con los que conviven y sobreviven. Resulta insólito que una película de la red comercial pueda ser fruto del proyecto de unos estudiantes de la Escuela de Cine de Munich que se adentraron en el desierto de Mongolia, para buscar una historia maravillosa que fuera real pero que, a la vez, se pudiera contar casi sin palabras. El resultado final ha sido un film con una delicadeza y un respeto hacia sus personajes como hacía años no se lograba en el cine.",56282,188,8,PT2M,0

It was coproduced by Alliance Atlantis and the National Film Board of Canada.


Kasparov had beaten Deep Blue, a computer designed specifically to beat him, in a match played in 1996. He agreed to offer a rematch the following year. Kasparov won the first game of the rematch easily with the white pieces. In the second game, Kasparov was struggling with the black pieces, but set a trap that most computers fall for. Deep Blue didn't fall for it and won to level the match, although Kasparov and Deep Blue both missed a perpetual check that could have given Kasparov a draw. The next three matches ended in draws, with Kasparov appearing to weaken psychologically. Deep Blue went on to win the decisive sixth game, marking the first time in history that a computer defeated the World Champion in a match of several games.


Synopsis
From this experience, particularly the second game of the match, Kasparov accused the IBM team of cheating. He suspected that a human player was used during the games to improve the strategic strength of the computer. As a metaphor for this suspicion, the film weaves in the story of the Turk, a hoax involving a chess-playing automaton built in the eighteenth century, but secretly operated by human beings. The film also implies that Deep Blue's heavily promoted victory was a ploy by IBM to boost its market value.",191084,824,351,PT1H24M59S,0

On Valentine's Day, she meets - and is smitten by - the truck driver Takatoshi (Nao Ohmori from Ichi the Killer).

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is Wes Anderson's fourth feature length film, released in the U.S. on December 25, 2004. It was written by Anderson and Noah Baumbach and was filmed in and around Naples, Ponza and the Italian Riviera.

The offbeat comedy stars Bill Murray as Steve Zissou, an eccentric oceanographer. In this ensemble cast, Steve Zissou sets out to exact revenge on the ""jaguar shark"" that ate his partner Esteban. Murray's character is both a parody of and homage to Jacques-Yves Cousteau, to whom the film is dedicated.

Rebels of the Neon God Official US Release Trailer 1 (2015) - Drama Movie HD

Tsai Ming-liang’s groundbreaking first feature, REBELS OF THE NEON GOD, already includes a handful of elements familiar to fans of subsequent work: a deceptively spare style often branded “minimalist;” actor Lee Kang-sheng as the silent and sullen Hsiao-kang; copious amounts of water, whether pouring from the sky or bubbling up from a clogged drain; and enough urban anomie to ensure that even the subtle humor in evidence is tinged with pathos. The loosely structured plot involves Hsiao-kang, a despondent cram school student, who becomes obsessed with young petty thief Ah-tze, after Ah-tze smashes the rearview mirror of a taxi driven by Hsiao-kang’s father. Hsiao-kang stalks Ah-tze and his buddy Ah-ping as they hang out in the film’s iconic arcade (featuring a telling poster of James Dean on the wall) and other locales around Taipei, and ultimately takes his revenge.",687530,637,26,PT2M2S,0

Arrowhead (1953) Official Trailer #1 - Charlton Heston Movie HD

Chief of Scouts Ed Bannon narrowly avoids an Apache ambush while working with the cavalry stationed at Fort Clark, Texas. The US Army is trying to talk peace with the Apaches and move them to reservations in Florida, and they take Bannon's efforts as detrimental to their new policies, so they fire him. When the Apache chief's son Torinada returns from an Eastern education, Bannon becomes highly suspicious of his motives based run-ins with Torinada in the past. Bannon continues shadowing the proceedings to the chagrin of both the US Army and the Apache warrior.

Robert Englund (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Galaxy of Terror, Freddy vs. Jason) assumes the classic role of The Phantom in this shocking, nerve-jangling retelling of Gaston Leroux's timeless tale of music, madness and murder!

An aspiring opera singer finds herself transported back to Victorian-era London – and into the arms of a reclusive, disfigured maestro determined to make her a star.

Al finalizar la Guerra del Golfo, y tras la retirada de las tropas, Herzog se adentra en los escenarios kuwaitíes del conflicto para filmar un paisaje tan inhóspito y desolador como poseedor de un inquietante y perverso atractivo: a la devastación bélica se suman los numerosos pozos de petróleo en llamas, torres de fuego que parecen emerger de la tierra creando un espectáculo sobrecogedor. Sobre ese telón de fondo, la cámara de Herzog narra varias cosas al mismo tiempo: las complejas y extremadamente peligrosas operaciones de extinción del fuego, la fractura sicológica y emocional que la guerra ha dejado en los habitantes, las dañinas consecuencias ecológicas que ha de afrontar Kuwait. Las imágenes se alzan hasta lo sublime, haciendo convivir en un mismo plano la belleza y el horror. Pese a la música que acompaña varios pasajes el silencio está siempre presente: como atestiguan una mujer y un niño, los propios habitantes han enmudecido. Ante semejante horror --viene a afirmar, en definitiva, la película-- no hay posibilidad de expresar nada. Y sólo cabe dar, una vez más, las gracias al director alemán por haber estado ahí para filmarlo. (Manuel Ferrari)
 -----------------------------------------
 Werner Herzog: Guest of Honor, 4+1 Film Festival 2012

At the end of the Gulf War, following the troops' withdrawal, Herzog travelled to Kuwait in order to explore this conflict in situ, filming a landscape as inhospitable and desolate as it is unnerving and perversely attractive: the devastation of war is exacerbated by the numerous oil wells in flames, towers of fire that appear to emerge from the earth, resulting in a deeply moving spectacle. With this backdrop, Herzog's camera narrates several stories at once: the complex and extremely dangerous operation of extinguishing these fires, the psychological and emotional scars the war has left on the country's inhabitants, and the harmful environmental consequences Kuwait must face. The images are often sublime, combining beauty and horror in a single shot. Despite the music used in several sequences, silence is ever-present: a woman and child serve to testify that even the inhabitants themselves have become mute. Ultimately the film affirms that it is impossible to express anything when faced with such horror. And, all we can do, once again, is thank the German director for having gone there to film it.

6199,3KiEP5Ctfk0,The Nomi Song trailer,"The Nomi Song is Andrew Horn's award-winning look at the life of German-born singer Klaus Nomi. One of the most profoundly bizarre characters of the late 70s/early 80s New Wave underground scene, Klaus Nomi was a genuine counter-tenor who sang pop music like opera to enthusiastic club audiences. Through archival performance footage and interviews with his friends and fellow artists, Nomi's influence and unique style are brought to life twenty-two years after his death from AIDS.

Part documentary, part music film and part sci-fi, The Nomi Song is a story of love of music and love of performing at a time when it seemed as though everyone was struck by a sense of urgency to make something - anything. A time of no limits. Klaus Nomi was on the verge of international fame as a singer when he tragically became one of the first gay artists to die of AIDS (then referred to as the ""gay cancer""). He was as much a genuine talent as he was the engine of his own destruction. He was an alien amongst the outcasts and an obviously tortured soul who, at the same time, radiated optimism when optimism was ""officially"" out of fashion. The Nomi Song is a story that grows out of a group of people who influenced him; people who felt used, cheated yet, overall, inspired. Featuring Ann Magnuson, Gabriele Lafari, David MacDermot, Page Wood, Tony Frere, Man Parrish, Kristian Hoffman, Ron Johnsen, Kenny Scharf, Anthony Scibelli, Alan Platt with a special appearance by David Bowie.

The Nomi Song features the music of Wire, The Marbles, The Bongos, Pylon, The Mumps, Chi Pig, and, of course, David Bowie. This DVD also includes Klaus Nomi performances, many never before seen since originally performed by Klaus including a full performance of ""The Cold Song"" with full orchestra - Klaus's ultimate performance.

6202,6orM84owB7M,Beautiful Boxer (2003) - Movie Trailer,"Rising even higher than the greatest expectations engendered by the International Press when it became a favorite of the film festivals, BEAUTIFUL BOXER is one of the more poetic, sensitive, luxuriously vivid and colorful films to come out of Thailand - and that is saying a lot, given the extravagant epics that yearly grow in popularity. This work of art is simply stunning in content, in direction, in acting, and in heartfelt simplicity of message. This is a great one! Writer/director Ekachai Uekrongtham based his first film on the true story of Parinaya Charoemphol AKA Nong Toom, a famous Thai athlete Muay Thai boxer (better known as 'kick boxer' - a demanding, dangerous sport) who entered the world of Muay Thai to garner enough money to help his family and pay for his ultimate sex-change surgery. A tough story to offer general audiences, perhaps, but Ekachai Uekrongtham presents this edgy biography with such cinematic finesse and care that it becomes a film that should appeal to a very wide audience. And much of that success is due to the towering performance by Asanee Suwan in his acting debut: Suwan is in life a professional kick boxer who won the title role after extensive auditions by many practitioners of Muay Thai.

BEAUTIFUL BOXER takes us through the life of Nong Toom, his childhood in a family of loving accepting parents who respect his love of beauty and things feminine, his brief period of being a monk who must leave the monastery because of his inclinations, through his introduction to makeup and play-acting women's roles in the Thai theaters, his ridicule as being more girl than boy (a fact that results in his parents' incarceration!), and his devoted friendship with a girl who supports his desire for femininity and a young man who stands up for him in the boys' camp for learning sports. Gradually Nong Toom realizes that the only way he can make enough money to achieve a sex change operation is to become a successful kick boxer and he aligns himself with a trainer Pi Chart (Sorapong Chatree) and with much commitment and practice becomes Thailand's most famous Muay Thai. His self-respect is further established when he openly wears makeup in the boxing ring, causing many to believe his act is a gimmick and not the manifestation of his true transsexualism. He fights the toughest opponents and wins consistently until he at last arrives in Toyko for the 'big purse' of fighting female wrestler Kyoko Inoue (who plays herself). With the money from the fight he is able to have his surgery and becomes the famous actress and model now living in Bangkok.

Under less sensitive eyes and minds this story could have become audacious, but instead the film elects to be sensitive to the transsexual conviction that Nong Toom is a woman trapped in a man's body, and it is the journey of self acceptance and personal victory that makes the story so deeply touching. Asanee Suwan, as a fine athlete, does all of his own fighting in the film and it is more choreography than brutality. He is amazing to watch and coupled with the fact that he is so wholly convincing in his fine acting that he makes this young transsexual utterly credible in movement, emotional density, and purity of vision is an extraordinary achievement.

Yes, the film has a few flaws of editing and other minor aspects, but the overwhelming power of the story more than compensates for those 'first film' learning curves. Highly recommended for ALL audiences, especially for those who fear there will be gratuitous physical scenes that might offend. There are none! Grady Harp

""Bette Davis gives a sharp, vital interpretation of Miss Moffat (the spinster teacher fighting to educate the poor children of a Welsh mining village)...by remaining true to its legitimate stage counterpart,"" said the Herald Tribune. The story, based on Emlyn Williams' autobiographical play, focuses on the relationship between Miss Moffat and her gifted young prodigy from the mines, Morgan Evans (John Dall). ""Consumed by inward fire, by the sheer joy of imparting knowledge"" (London Picture Post), she molds him into a legitimate candidate for an Oxford scholarship in the remarkably short span of two years. Despite the disaster of Morgan's seduction by trouble-making Bessie (Joan Lorring), the mutual struggle between teacher and pupil becomes a glorious triumph of the human spirit.

""Only Bette Davis...could have combated so successfully the obvious intention of the adaptors of the play to make frustrated sex the mainspring of the plot,"" observed Picture Post.

6292,9RNWy5VpL8Q,Digitally Remastered This Sporting Life,"Network is proud to bring THIS SPORTING LIFE (15) to DVD on 3rd November 2008, one of the most notable films from cinemas British New Wave phase. It is director Lindsay Andersons multi-award winning, gritty and powerful northern drama, featuring a breakout performance from Richard Harris (Gladiator, Harry Potter) with strong support from Rachel Roberts (Saturday Night Sunday Morning), both of whom are on tremendous form in one of the films that came to define the sixties. This version of the film has been taken from an HD print in the correct aspect ratio so this is the first time the film can be viewed on DVD as it was meant for a cinema audience.

Frank Machin is a miner who lodges with Mrs. Hammond, a widow. His competitive nature and powerful physique lead him to join the local rugby team. With a progressing sports career comes success  and perhaps a new sense of insecurity  which seems to make Frank harsher and cruder than he already is. But his inability to articulate his sensitive side only serves to alienate people further

With both Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts turning in powerhouse performances (which won Harris an award for Best Actor at Cannes and Roberts a nomination) plus a Palm dOr nomination at Cannes for director Lindsay Anderson, this is an unflinching look at the lives of the working class set in the bleak landscape of northern England.

Special features on this DVD are:
•Digital restoration of the film in the correct aspect ratio
•Original Theatrical Trailer
•Extensive image gallery
•Promotional and Script PDFs

——

""Die wilden Papageien von Telegraph Hill"" ist ein mehrfach prämiertes Meisterwerk und berührt nicht nur durch seine Dokumentation über die Interaktion zwischen Mensch und Tier sondern auch durch die dahinter verborgene Liebesgeschichte, basierend auf einer wahren Begebenheit. Der Film handelt von der Beziehung eines ehemaligen Straßenmusikers und einem Schwarm wilder Papageien, die den Musiker ins Glück führen. Herzzerreißend offenbart ein Papagei nach dem anderen seinen ganz individuellen Charakter und bezaubert mit seiner eigenen Persönlichkeit.  Der Film erzielte in den USA das höchste inspielergebnis aller Tierdokumentationen und ist ein landesweiter Klassiker. Doch auch für die Dokumentarfilmerin Judy Irving hat dieser Film eine ganz besondere Bedeutung, denn er hat ihr Leben maßgeblich verändert. Ein Film für die ganze Familie, der die Sicht auf die Tiere in unserer unmittelbaren Umgebung weitet und zeigt, dass nichts ohne Grund geschieht bzw. präsent ist. 

Nominiert für den Cosmic Angel Award beim COSMIC CINE FILM FESTIVAL 2013

While traveling through the United States, Gilberte Valandray got married to an American, Eric Thomson. This first marriage ended in failure.
However, given that the wedding was not registered by the French consul, it is not accepted as legal on home soil. To all intents and purposes, it didn't take place.
Once back in Paris, Gilberte then married Georges Valandray, a powerful businessman working in the steel industry. Georges now basks in conjugal bliss, oblivious to the fact that he is not his wife's first husband. The lie is carefully maintained. Only Gilberte's sister, Arlette Poumaillac, who is still single, is in on the secret.
But what would happen if, by pure coincidence, Georges had business dealings with Eric and consequently became friends with him?

When Nazi troops seize his town, timid schoolmaster Albert Lory (Charles Laughton) submits to his new masters, although he cannot help but be inspired by the defiance of many of his fellow citizens. Then Albert is hauled before a tribunal, falsely accused of murder. Standing alone against the power of the Third Reich, this seemingly weak man then reveals an invincible soul. Three of cinema's most acclaimed talents -- Laughton, director Jean Renoir (Grand Illusion) and screenwriter Dudley Nichols (Stagecoach) -- unite for this moving portrait of the heroism of everyday men and women. The stellar cast includes Maureen O'Hara (Laughton's protégée and his The Hunchback of Notre Dame costar) as the colleague he secretly loves, George Sanders as a covert collaborator, and Walter Slezak as a wily Nazi officer who holds Albert's fate in his hands. ""A courageous film...a story cleanly and maturely told"" (Bosley Crowther, The New York Times).

Directed By Jean Renoir
Starring Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara, George Sanders

The film is set in Central Industrial Prison, a maximum security prison in the middle of the desert. An outbreak of violence within the prison has resulted in a total lockdown. A committee is appointed by the prison's governors to investigate the cause of the outbreak, but their findings are in stark contrast to the facts behind the riot. As the viewers see, both the prisoners and the guards are slowly and deliberately brutalised, manipulated and provoked into the forthcoming eruption of violence, to justify the construction of a new and more ""secure"" facility.

Michael Powell, award-winning director of seminal classics Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes embarked on his final feature length film, returning to the themes and inspirations that established him as one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation.
 
Age of Consent explores the intense and often obsessive nature of an artist facing the sunset of his career - taking stock of his life and ultimate worth. James Mason (Lolita, The Verdict) is Bradley Morahan, a commercially successful but creatively jaded painter,  who retires from the bustle of New York to seek the tranquillity and peace of Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

It was premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival where it won a Prix du Regard Original Award.

The film was well received by film critics and at the film festival it was screened. Critic Manohla Dargis, writing for the New York Times said, ""the film is a model of both fiscal and narrative economy, and the kind of work – gleaned from the mysteries of consciousness, telling quotidian details and a sense of aesthetic proportion – that is too often missing from American independent cinema.""

IMDB:

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0331370/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1


In 2001, a small film, 25 Watts, shot in black-and-white in 16mm for $200,000, won prizes at the festivals of Rotterdam, Buenos Aires and Havana, and got widely distributed. What was unusual was that the film was co-directed by two 26-year-olds, Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll, who came from Uruguay, a country hardly ever associated with cinema. Three years later, the duo had an even bigger success, with Whisky, and were busy writing a much-anticipated third screenplay when Rebella, aged 32, committed suicide.

Rebella and Stoll were both born in Montevideo, and got to know each other at the Catholic University of Montevideo when they were studying communications. They then both worked in publicity and television, co-writing and directing an animation series entitled El Service, and two acclaimed shorts, Buenos y Santos and Victor y los Elejidos. This led to the fresh and funny 25 Watts, which follows three young layabouts during a weekend in Monte-video, when they try to allay boredom by drinking beer, talking about girls and philosophising about life.

Offering reasons for their country's meagre cinematic output, Rebella and Stoll said: ""It is extremely difficult to produce a film in Uruguay because it is difficult to produce anything at all in Uruguay."" They also revealed, jokingly, that the only Uruguayan in the Guinness Book of Records is a man who clapped his hands non-stop for five days.

The wonderfully droll and award-winning Whisky consolidated their position and put Uruguay firmly on the cinematic map. Yet the directors only managed to scrape together enough money to make the film with the help of individuals and businesses from several countries.

An example of the production's hand-to-mouth existence was that the car driven by one of the main characters was sold to a junkyard during the eight-week shoot. ""Why, after a youthful and autobiographical film like 25 Watts, did we produce a film about two 60-year-old Jewish brothers, a woman and a stocking factory?"" asked Rebella. ""Well, as we wrote the script, we started to realise that perhaps these characters were not so different from ourselves; that we were not so far away from this kind of loneliness. They could be a projection of ourselves in 20 or 30 years time."" ""Whisky"" is the Uruguayan equivalent of saying ""cheese"" in front of a camera.

As their two features were both melancholy and funny, it is tempting to conclude that the tall, thin and dark Rebella contributed the former aspect while the shorter, blond and stocky Stoll supplied the humour. A few weeks ago, Rebella sent some pages of the new script to the producer. He also announced his intention to go, with Stoll, to the Locarno film festival in August. However, in the early hours of July 14, he was discovered by his girlfriend and Stoll in his apartment in downtown Montevideo, sitting in a chair, in front of his computer, with a gunshot to his head and a .32 gun beside him. He had apparently consumed half a bottle of whisky.",70653,276,61,PT1M55S,0

The Amityville Horror is a 2005 American horror film directed by Andrew Douglas. The screenplay by Scott Kosar and Sandor Stern is based on the 1977 novel of the same name by Jay Anson, which was inspired by a real-life November 1974 incident in which Ronald DeFeo, Jr. shot dead six members of his family in their Long Island home.

The film is a remake of a 1979 screen adaptation that spawned several sequels that had little to do with the original story.
***************************
STORY PLOT
George and Kathy Lutz and her three children from a previous marriage move into what they believe will be their dream home, 412 Ocean Avenue situated on the waterfront in Amityville, New York. When George questions the asking price, which is well below market value, the realtor confesses the house was the scene of a brutal murder committed by Ronald DeFeo, the son of the former owners, who killed his family in their sleep with a rifle a year earlier. Despite some misgivings, George acquiesces to his wife's wishes and purchases the property.",316943,491,57,PT2M31S,0

In 1942, a recruiter from one such Napola sets his sights on Friedrich, a talented adolescent boxer, who sees the training and prestige offered by the Napola as his ticket out of an impoverished family unit run by his anti-Nazi father.

In the Napola, Friedrich learns to fight without pity, becoming a formidable killing machine. Propagandistic classes reinforce a hardened worldview of his Aryan superiority.

Meanwhile, Friedrich forms a bond with fellow cadet Albrecht Stein, an aspiring writer and son of the local Nazi governor. Governor Stein dotes on Friedrich, barely masking his contempt for his own son's sensitivity. But Friedrich admires and empathizes with his friend, even though Albrecht criticizes Friedrich's brutality in the ring.

As the war escalates, the school's military training also intensifies. Unscrupulous trainers humiliate the more vulnerable cadets in front of their peers and send the others out on dubious war game exercises. In one such nightmarish event, they instruct Friedrich and Albrecht to shoot escaping POW's who turn out to be unarmed Russian civilians. Tormented with guilt, Albrecht rebels, and Friedrich must choose between his sworn allegiance to the Fuehrer and his best friend's moral imperative.",297655,475,79,PT1M38S,0

6373,F_VT7GqlTmY,Original Theatrical Trailer | The Search | Warner Archive,"The Search (1948) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #TheSearch

In post-World War II Germany, a small boy who survived Auschwitz wanders alone -- feral, mute and terrified. He finds a makeshift home with a big-hearted GI, while the mother he does not remember searches desperately for him. Starring a then-unknown Montgomery Clift in his movie debut, directed in a near-documentary style by Fred Zinnemann and filmed in the ragged, rubble-strewn skeleton of Nuremberg, The Search vividly captures the horrifying human cost of war. This milestone of filmmaking won two 1948 Academy Awards®: Best Motion Picture Story and a special award to Ivan Jandl for his haunting performance as the lost child.

Directed By Fred Zinnemann
Starring Montgomery Clift, Ivan Jandl, Aline MacMahon

6377,JTZwKbJgoDk,KES - Brand New Masters of Cinema Trailer (SD version),"One of the most beloved and iconic British films of all time (voted in the top 10 of all time by the British Film Institute), Ken Loach’s breakthrough cinematic feature Kes is a cornerstone of naturalistic filmmaking whose influence is felt up to the present day.
 
Portraying with remarkable detail and empathy the day-to-day existence of a working-class 15-year-old boy in Barnsley (an unforgettable performance by David Bradley), and the profound change that the rearing of a kestrel brings to his otherwise troubled home life, Kes has enchanted generations of viewers since its release.
 
A rich, gently poetic work, filled with Loach’s trademark respect for his characters and astonishing skill at eliciting outstanding performances, The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present the film in a definitive Blu-ray special edition.

From acclaimed Spanish director Joaquín Oristrell, Unconscious is a delightful period comedy that questions sexual taboos in Barcelona in the early 20th century, yet resonates with a modern sensibility. With the beginnings of psychoanalysis and a visit from Freud as a leitmotiv and background, brother and sister-in-law Salvador and Alma become involved in a search for her missing husband.  Hypnosis, love, danger, and every imaginable taboo are intertwined.

Leonor Watling (Bad Education) is simply outstanding as nine-months pregnant Alma, a neurotic yet lovable character.  As the love-struck Salvador, Luis Tosar (Miami Vice) confirms himself as one of Spain's greatest actors. The couple's chemistry helps make this film a rare and special treasure.

According to the Amazon.Com description: In 1943 John Ford gave the great cinematographer Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane, The Grapes of Wrath) an opportunity to direct his first film. What was intended to be a short documentary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor grew into a veritable epic, framed by a debate between Walter Huston's Uncle Sam and Harry Davenport's Mr. C on the true nature of the Pacific paradise. Hawaiian history, rah-rah patriotism, and arguments over the loyalty of the Japanese-American population are capped by a stunning re-creation of the battle so convincing that feature films borrowed footage from it for decades. Arch and dated, it's a fascinating slice of history that until a few years ago was never seen by the public. Toland's criticisms of the American Navy caused it to be withheld until Ford could cut the 82-minute feature into a half-hour short, removing the history and analysis and concentrating solely on the battle and the recovery.",45986,204,19,PT1H21M33S,0

On top of that, he has a beautiful model wife named Sonja Slowinski, although many within his social circle don't see her as being a good influence on him. But Frankie has disappeared from the Ibiza club scene now for a year, with most only speculating that his life has degenerated into squalor based on his excessive lifestyle in Ibiza. In reality, Frankie's current disappearance and his ultimate fate is due in part to his excessive substance abuse, especially of cocaine, but also partly due to exposure to continual loud music and a physical disorder: he went completely deaf, with no possibility of getting his hearing back. As he went from partial hearing to total deafness, Frankie believed he could still eke out a living as a DJ without telling many of his descent into total deafness...

6438,Z_N5ZV9HGuA,Heights (2004) - Movie Trailer,"Decepcion and secrecy seems to be the root of the burden Jonathan is carrying in his troubled soul. During the course of a few hours he will have to face the truth about himself as his past comes back to haunt him in ways he didn't realize it would affect him.

Amy Fox has opened up her play by writing a wonderful screen treatment that Chris Terrio, the young and multi talented director presents for us with great panache. Ms. Fox created strong characters that come alive in the film. We are taken to some of Manhattan's rooftops and terraces to get a first rate account of people trying to deal with real problems. A point the film is trying to make is about how well do we know people close to us, even those we think we are in love with.

At the center of the movie is Elizabeth, who is living with Jonathan. They are planning to get married. Elizabeth is a talented photographer who is a free lancer. Jonathan is Jewish, but she is not; he wants her to go to see the Rabbi who is going to marry them. It's clear they are not at the same wave length, and not because they come from different religious backgrounds.

Diane, Elizabeth's mother, is a much admired actress in the New York stage. She has an eye for spotting handsome young men, as it's the case when she auditions Alec, a young actor that wants to be in a play she is going to direct. It's clear she likes him for other non acting role as well. Diane and her present husband are married for appearances sake, as we get to see him in action with another woman.

""Heights"" makes an interesting point in showing how inter connected all these characters are and how a small, innocent incident, will unravel things as Elizabeth gets to see first hand how wrong she has been about the man she is going to marry.

Glenn Close, as Diana, makes an amazing appearance in the film. She is such an elegant performer that knows well what makes Diana act the way she does. She is not a diva, on the contrary, she seems to be a grounded woman whose love for her daughter is clear. Elizabeth Banks is wonderful as Diana's daughter, Isabel.

The surprise of the film came via George Segal, who as Rabbi Mendel, clearly sees what's troubling Jonathan. Mr. Segal is a welcome sight in the film after being absent so long. James Marsden, Jesse Bradford, Rufus Wainwright, Eric Bogosian, Michael Murphy and a lot of New York based stage actors are seen in minor, but effective roles.

This film clearly demonstrates the talent of Chris Terrio bringing all these actors together to do ensemble work. Mr. Terrio is lucky to be working with Jim Denault who has photographed the film with such an elegant style. Also the music by Ben Butler and Martin Erskine enhances the film.",287066,215,24,PT1M52S,0

Out in California's San Fernando Valley, Isabel is trying to reinvent herself. A naïve, good-natured witch, she is determined to disavow her supernatural powers and lead a normal life. At the same time, across town, Jack Wyatt a tall, charming actor is trying to get his career back on track. He sets his sights on an updated version of the beloved 1960s situation comedy Bewitched, re-conceived as a starring vehicle for himself in the role of the mere-mortal Darrin. Fate steps in when Jack accidentally runs into Isabel. He is immediately attracted to her and her nose, which bears an uncanny resemblance to the nose of Elizabeth Montgomery, who played Samantha in the original TV version of Bewitched. He becomes convinced she could play the witch Samantha in his new series. Isabel is also taken with Jack, seeing him as the quintessential mortal man with whom she can settle down and lead the normal life she so desires. It turns out they're both right--but in ways neither of them ever imagined.

Richard, a newly single salesman and father of two boys, is prepared for amazing things to happen. But when the captivating Christine enters his life, he panics. Christine vacillates between heartbreak and faith as she weaves together reality and the fantastical in her art and life. Miranda July is one of a kind: a video artist crossing over into indie cinema, a female writer, director and actress, a success in the gallery, at festivals and in theatres. This, her feature debut, was her breakthrough, and is eccentrically sad as it is wonderfully funny.

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.

One of Russell's most gloriously lurid fantasias, with Richard Chamberlain and Glenda Jackson brilliant as the haunted composer and his mad nymphomaniacal wife. Despite its many memorable and even shocking sequences this musical fever dream was savaged by the critics, with Pauline herself opining, ""You really feel you should drive a stake through the heart of the man who made it. I mean it is so vile. It is so horrible.""

Thank you.

""Miracles"" is a lavish martial-arts comic melodrama set in the 1930's. One of the most expensive Hong Kong movies ever made, it took nine months to shoot and cost $HK 64,000,000 to make. The subtle, Scorsese-inspired tracking shots, elegant montages, and innovative action sequences, indicate the level of care and attention that Jackie put into this labour of love, inspired by ""Pocketful of Miracles"". Even today, the movie rates as one of the most technically proficient projects ever produced by a Hong Kong studio.

As well as its technical accolades, the movie is also a 'must' for action fans. Each of the movie's fight sequences is very well conceived and the movie carried off the top award for 'Best Fight Coreography' at the 1990 Hong Kong Critics Awards.

Combining action, romance and Chan's remarkable physical comedy, ""Miracles"" is a dynamic martial-arts extravaganza, which has played to great acclaim at film festivals all over the World.

6515,Skj_9zmhlC0,Michael Schlesinger on BABY FACE,"Barbara Stanwyck’s spiky strumpet literally sleeps her way to the top in Baby Face, the Sui Generis of gleefully prurient pre-code films that made Warner Bros. ground zero for gloriously salacious entertainment before Will Hays and his fun-killing code spoiled the party. Though Stanwyck’s character engages in some situations that would raise eyebrows even in 2020, she naturally has a heart of gold and and poker-faced George Brent is the lucky fella who benefits (for the time being, at least). Director Alfred Green (Invasion U.S.A.) specialized in fast-paced, low-budget exploitation fare but thanks to Stanwyck’s all-out performance, Baby Face remains his most memorable achievement.

Joan Crawford, William Powell and Robert Montgomery shine in this sparkling drawing room comedy, costarring Frank Morgan, Jessie Ralph and Nigel Bruce. When wealthy American widow Fay Cheyney (Crawford) sets up house in London, she quickly becomes the darkling of British society. But looks can be deceiving, as Fay and her butler, Charles (Powell), are really part of a gang planning to steal a duchess' pearls. So when a smitten Lord Arthur (Montgomery) catches Fay taking the jewels, she must find a way to keep him silent and get herself and the crooks off the hook. Based on the 1925 stage play by Frederick Lonsdale, the 1937 version of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney was the second of three screen adaptations by M-G-M. Originally filmed in 1929 with Norma Shearer, the studio's third version, The Law and the Lady (1951), would star Greer Garson as the glamorous thief.

Directed By Richard Boleslawski
Starring Robert Montgomery, Joan Crawford, William Powell

6545,o8JvMdfNOrg,Dreamchild (1985) - Video Trailer,"Dennis Potter's haunting, melancholy fictional take on the real-life Alice of Charles L. Dodgson's (aka Lewis Carroll's) masterpieces; ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"" and ""Through The Looking-Glass"".

An elderly Alice (Coral Browne) travels to New York to be a special guest in the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Dodgson's birth. Flustered by press and public attention, she begins to call up hidden memories from that period and reflect on her childhood and her friendship with Dodgson (Ian Holm). She has trouble reconciling these memories, and the complex feelings she has toward them, within the bittersweet scope of her memory of her life through time; a life that has lead her to her present state of reflection in her autumnal years. Phantoms of ambivalence and contradiction and nostalgia begin to spill over into her reality and into the reality of the film, as manifestations of characters from Carroll's text (brought to boldly realized life by Jim Henson and his Creature Shop) are conjured up, as the film sifts through her memories and staged scenes from the books.",72229,224,26,PT1M19S,0
6546,8fKjZDgat_0,My Cousin Rachel 1952 Trailer,"Based on the best-selling novel by Daphne du Maurier (author of the peerless Rebecca), My Cousin Rachel (1952) weaves an eerie tale of Gothic romance, set against the backdrop of the wild, rock-ribbed Cornish coast. Richard Burton, in his first American film role, stars as an anguished young Englishman, torn between dark suspicion of and an uncontrollable passion for his guardian's widow, the alluring and mysterious Rachel (Olivia de Havilland). With atmospheric direction by Henry Koster (The Robe) and a darkly romantic score by Franz Waxman (Sunset Boulevard), My Cousin Rachel is a seductive entry in the annals of cinematic ambiguity.

6547,AUb7aNsbBSk,The Key 1958   William Holden   Sophia Loren Clip,"Synopsis:
The strain of war on relationships is the terrain Carol Reed explores in this grim WWII drama. THE KEY stars Sophia Loren as Stella, a young Swiss woman whose grief over the death of her fiancé has led her to offer herself to a string of others who share his dangerous profession. Like Chris Ford (Trevor Howard), her current lover, he captained a tugboat that patrolled U-boat lanes, rescuing damaged cargo ships. Believing that his number also will soon be up, Ford gives Stella's apartment key to his friend David Ross (William Holden), another tug captain, only recently arrived in England. After Ford's death, Ross overcomes his initial reluctance and makes use of the key. Stella is touched by Ross's vulnerability, and the two quickly fall in love. But, given her past, Ross is still not entirely sure of her love. Eventually he must take on an extremely perilous assignment from which he believes he won't return and must decide whether to pass the key along to another man. THE KEY is a complicated, rewarding film, most notable perhaps for its gritty, exciting scenes of naval rescue.

Long before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon wowed the western world, Come Drink With Me set an entirely new standard for martial arts movies in the Far East. Director King Hu not only broke new ground but set the groundwork for all the action films that followed, including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Come Drink With Me tells the story of a mysterious swordswoman nicknamed ""Golden Swallow"", and the even more mysterious swordsman, ""Beggar"". They join forces to free a kidnapped official from a Buddhist monastery run by a corrupt abbot with incredible kung-fu powers.
